Hello, and welcome! Wiktionary is a [[multilingual]] [[free]] [[dictionary]], being written [[collaborative]]ly on this website by people from around the world. [[entry|Entries]] may be [[Help:How to edit a page|edit]]ed by anyone!

You are reading the '''English''' version of this multilingual '''dictionary of all languages,''' in which all words of all languages are explained in English, in a [[descriptivist]] (not [[prescriptivist]]) way. In the left sidebar you will find links to other language versions of Wiktionary, in which the definitions are presented in other languages; each Wiktionary has a language code in its URL that designates which language it uses for its explanations.

Designed as the lexical companion to [[:w:Main Page|Wikipedia]], the encyclopedia project, Wiktionary has grown beyond a standard dictionary and now includes a [[Wiktionary:Wikisaurus|thesaurus]], a rhyme guide, phrase books, language statistics and extensive appendices.  We aim to include not only the definition of a word, but also enough information to really understand it. Thus [[etymology|etymologies]], pronunciations, sample quotations, synonyms, antonyms, translations, etc., are included.

Wiktionary is a [[wiki]], which means that you can edit it, and all the content is dual-licensed under both the [[Wiktionary:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]] as well as the [[Wiktionary:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]]. Before you contribute, you may wish to read through some of our [[Wiktionary:Help|Help]] pages, and bear in mind that we do things quite differently from other wikis. In particular, we have strict [[Wiktionary:Entry layout|layout conventions]] and [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|inclusion criteria]]. Learn how to [[Help:Starting a new page|start a page]], how to [[Help:How to edit a page|edit entries]], experiment in the [[Wiktionary:Sandbox|sandbox]] and visit our [[Wiktionary:Community Portal|Community Portal]] to see how you can participate in the development of Wiktionary.

We have created '''{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}''' entries since starting in December, 2002, and we’re still growing.

==Editing Wiktionary==
People like you are very active in building this [[project]]. While you are reading this, it is likely someone is editing one of our entries. Many knowledgeable people are already at work, but everybody is [[welcome]]!

Contributing does not require [{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup}} logging in], but we would [[prefer]] that you do, as it [[facilitate]]s the [[administration]] of this site. (Note that logging in also prevents the [[Internet Protocol|IP]] address of your computer from being displayed in the [{{fullurl:Wiktionary:Welcome, newcomers|action=history}} page history].)

You can [[dive in]] right now and add or alter a definition, add example sentences, or help us to properly format or categorize entries. You can even [[Help:Starting a new page|create a page]] for a term we’re missing. Please feel free to [[Wiktionary:Be bold in updating pages|be bold]] in editing pages!

How could allowing everyone to edit produce a high‐quality product instead of total disorder?  Because most people want to help, and keeping it open to everyone creates the potential for making many good and ever-improving entries. Records are kept of all changes, so even unhelpful edits can easily be [[revert]]ed by other users. To use a now‐famous catchphrase, in essence: “[[given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow|Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow]].”

To start out, users might want to use the ‘[[Special:Recentchanges|Recent changes]]’ or ‘[[Special:Random|Random page]]’ link (found in the navigation box elsewhere on this page), to get an idea of the kinds of pages you can find here. (It might be surprising how many non-English words are entered here!)

==Norms and etiquette==
{{xsee|Help:Interacting with other users}}
One important thing you should know is that we have borrowed from our sister project [[Wikipedia:|Wikipedia]] some [[Wikipedia:Norm (sociology)|cultural norms]] you should respect:
# We try not to argue pointlessly. This isn’t a debate forum. After [[civilized]] and reasonable discussion, we try to reach broad [[consensus]] in order to present an accurate, neutral summary of all relevant facts for future readers.
# We try to make the entries as unbiased as we can, meaning that definitions or descriptions — even of controversial topics — are not meant to be platforms for preaching of any kind.
# Bear in mind this is a ''dictionary'', which means there are many [[Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not|things it is not]].
# At any point, if you are uncomfortable changing someone else’s work, and you want to add a thought (or question or comment) about an entry or other page, the place is its [[Wiktionary:Talk page|talk page]] (click on the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top or the &quot;Discuss this page&quot; link in the sidebar or elsewhere, depending on your preference skin). Note, though, that we try to keep discussion focused on improving this dictionary.

However, there are also some differences between Wikipedia and Wiktionary. If you already have some experience with editing Wikipedia, then you may find our [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary for Wikipedians|guide to Wikipedia users]] useful as a quick introduction.

      <text bytes="2777" xml:space="preserve">The '''GNU Free Documentation License''' (GFDL) is a [[w:copyleft|copyleft]] license for free documentation, designed by the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) for the [[w:GNU|GNU]] project.  The official text of version 1.1 of the license text can be found at: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html

The license is designed for software documentation and other reference and instructional materials. It stipulates that any copy of the material, even if modified, carry the same license. Those copies may be sold but, if produced in quantity, have to be made available in a format which facilitates further editing. 

== Secondary Sections ==

The license explicitly separates the &quot;[[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Document|Document]]&quot; from &quot;[[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Secondary Sections|Secondary Sections]]&quot;, which may not be integrated with the Document, but exist as front-matter materials or appendices. Secondary sections can contain information regarding the author's or publisher's relationship to the subject matter, but not any subject matter itself. While the Document itself is wholly editable, and is essentially covered by a license equivalent to the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]], some of the secondary sections have various restrictions designed primarily to deal with proper attribution to previous authors.

Specifically, the authors of prior versions have to be acknowledged and certain &quot;invariant sections&quot; specified by the original author and dealing with his or her relationship to the subject matter may not be changed.  If the material is modified, its title has to be changed (unless the prior authors give permission to retain the title). The license also has provisions for the handling of [[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Cover_Texts|front-cover and back-cover texts]] of books, as well as for &quot;History&quot;, &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot; and &quot;Endorsements&quot; sections.

== Using the GFDL ==

For a document to be covered by the GFDL, one must include a specific copyright and license notice.

== Wiktionary and GFDL ==

All Wiktionary articles are licensed to the public under the GNU Free Documentation License. See [[Wiktionary:Copyrights]] for the details. The local copy of the license, as required by the terms of the GFDL, is at [[Wiktionary:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License]].

Version 1.1, March 2000

&lt;pre&gt;
Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== 0. PREAMBLE ==

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

==  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS ==

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

== 2. VERBATIM COPYING ==

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

== 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY ==

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

== 4. MODIFICATIONS ==

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
* B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
* C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
* D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
* E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
* F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
* G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
* H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
* I. Preserve the section entitled &quot;History&quot;, and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
* J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
* K. In any section entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
* L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
* M. Delete any section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
* N. Do not retitle any existing section as &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

== 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS ==

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot;

== 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS ==

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

== 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS ==

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an &quot;aggregate&quot;, and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

== 8. TRANSLATION ==

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

== 9. TERMINATION ==

Wiktionary is an online [[dictionary]] and, as a means to that end, also an [[w:online community|online community]]. Therefore, there are certain things that Wiktionary is ''not''.

== What Wiktionary is not ==

# Wiktionary is '''not an [[encyclopedia]], a genealogy database, or an atlas'''; that is, it is not an in-depth collection of factual information, or of data about places and people. Encyclopedic information should be placed in our sister project, [[w:Main page|Wikipedia]]. Wiktionary entries are about words. A Wiktionary entry should focus on matters of language and wordsmithing: spelling, pronunciation, etymology, translation, concept, usage, quotations{{,}} and links to related words. 
# Wiktionary is '''not an [[arbiter]] of what is good English'''; correct English, acceptable English, suitable English, or even grammatical.  This also applies to entries for non-English terms. Wiktionary [[describes]] usage, it does not [[prescribe]] nor [[proscribe]] it, and adheres only to its [[WT:CFI|criteria for inclusion]], which state that any term or meaning that can be shown to be in sufficiently widespread use may be included. By including or not including a certain term, it by no means accepts or attempts to promote a certain point of view, but is simply documenting, explaining what '''is or was in use''' in English or any other language.
#&lt;span id=&quot;CRYSTAL&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wiktionary is '''not a [[crystal ball]]'''. Wiktionary does not try to predict which new words will actually achieve use. It usually depends on verifiable proof of usage over a year.
#&lt;span id=&quot;NOTPAPER&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wiktionary is '''[[m:Wiki is not paper|not paper]]'''. Thus, Wiktionary effectively has no size limits, can include links, can be more timely, etc. It also means that the style and length of writing appropriate for paper may not be appropriate here. There is less need to use abbreviations. There is less need to exclude arguable entries. If enough people support a well-formed entry, then there should be no need to call for its deletion.
# Wiktionary is '''not a soapbox, chatroom{{,}} or discussion forum'''. However, there are [[Wiktionary:Discussion rooms|discussion rooms]] to discuss Wiktionary-related topics. 
# Wiktionary is '''neither a [[w:Mirror (computing)|mirror]] nor a repository of links, images{{,}} or media files'''. Any content added to Wiktionary may be subject to merciless editing or deletion. 
# Wiktionary is '''not a free wiki host or webspace provider'''. You may not host your own website at Wiktionary. If you are interested in using the [[wiki]] technology for a collaborative effort on anything other than writing a dictionary of all words in all languages, even if it is just a single page, there are many sites that provide wiki hosting. You can even install [[mw:|Wiktionary's wiki software]] on your server.
# Wiktionary is '''not a battlefield'''. Every user is expected to interact with others [[Wiktionary:Civility|civilly]], calmly and in a spirit of cooperation. Do not [[Wiktionary:No personal attacks|insult]], harass or intimidate those with whom you have a disagreement. Rather, approach the matter in an intelligent manner, and engage in polite discussion. Do not create or edit entries just to prove a point. Do not make legal or other threats against Wiktionary, Wiktionarians{{,}} or the Wikimedia Foundation. Threats are not tolerated and may result in a [[WT:BLOCK|ban]].
# Wiktionary is '''not [[w:Censorship|censored]]''' (nor is it [[w:MPAA film rating system|content-rated]]). Anyone can edit an entry and the results are displayed instantaneously; thus, we cannot guarantee that someone will not see or read something objectionable.  In addition, Wiktionary has no organized system for the removal of material that might be thought likely to harm minors. However, entries (almost always, images) can be censored by consensus.
# Wiktionary is '''not just for English'''. Wiktionary is a dictionary written in one language and covering all words in all languages, just as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia written in one language of all topics from all language-areas. Each Wiktionary seeks to define all words from all languages in its own language, so that readers will be able to find definitions of all words in all languages in their own language. This Wiktionary is written in English, so it is in a way an English dictionary, an English-to-anything and an anything-to-English dictionary all in one. Although one could look up {{m|fr|être}} at fr.wiktionary ([[:fr:être]]), its definition will be in French. So if that person doesn’t speak any French, they still wouldn’t know what ''être'' meant, and it wouldn’t be of any help to them.

== Wiktionary is not Wikipedia ==
{{shortcut|WT:WINW}}
{{main|Wiktionary:Wiktionary for Wikipedians}}

Although Wiktionary and Wikipedia are sister projects, '''Wiktionary is not Wikipedia'''. Some of our policies are similar to some of Wikipedia's policies; others are quite different. The way we do things here is similar in some respects to the way things are done at Wikipedia; in other respects, it's very different.

; Differences in content
:* Unlike Wikipedia, Wiktionary does not have a &quot;notability&quot; criterion; rather, we have an &quot;attestation&quot; criterion, and (for multi-word terms) an &quot;idiomaticity&quot; requirement. There are some similarities here — [[w:Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up one day|neither Wiktionary nor Wikipedia is for &quot;things made up one day&quot;]] — but also some differences. Our &quot;attestation&quot; requirement is much less subjective than Wikipedia's &quot;notability&quot; requirement; and we include all terms in all languages, including very obscure or rare terms, provided they meet [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|our criteria for inclusion (CFI)]].
:* Wiktionary is a ''secondary source'' for its subject matter (words and phrases) whereas Wikipedia is a ''tertiary source'' for its subject matter (topics). This means that while Wikipedia documents what other people say about topics, Wiktionary documents words and phrases itself without relying on the statements of other people. As a consequence, the requirements of verifiability are very different. Verification on Wikipedia asks &quot;can we find a credible source that says it is the case?&quot; while on Wiktionary we ask &quot;can we find real-life examples to show it is the case?&quot;. This also means that whereas Wikipedia discourages original research and relies on the research of others, Wiktionary users themselves actively research terms and their meanings.

; Differences in community
:* Wiktionary has a different [[WT:BLOCK|blocking policy]] than Wikipedia, and administrators don't usually issue warnings unless edits can be assumed to have been made in good faith.
:* Because there are so many pages on Wiktionary with relatively little content, talk pages of individual pages are not often used. Instead, discussion is usually centralised in [[WT:BP|Beer Parlour]], [[WT:TR|Tea room]] and other discussion rooms.
:* Unlike Wikipedia, which encourages users to be creative with user boxes on their personal pages, Wiktionary allows only userboxes that are relevant to your work on Wiktionary itself. This includes most importantly [[WT:Babel|language userboxes]], which display the languages that you know.

; Differences in organization
:* Unlike Wikipedia, Wiktionary's page names are case sensitive. [[Hand]] and [[hand]] are different pages. When several pages exist that differ only in their capitalisation, the template {{temp|also}} is placed at the very beginning of the page to redirect between them.
:* There are no disambiguation pages on Wiktionary, and we do not create redirects for alternative forms, spellings or inflected forms of words. Instead, a small stub entry is created with a template that links back to the main form. Many such stub entries are created automatically using various [[WT:BOT|bots]].

; Differences in page format and wikitext
:* Wiktionary has a very rigid page format, detailed at [[WT:EL|Entry Layout]].
:* Wiktionary makes heavy use of templates for all kinds of things, and each language often has its own set of templates. Learning to use the templates of the language you are working on is very important; templates can be found at [[:Category:Templates by language]]. Categories, formatting and linking also often use templates for consistent formatting.
:* Wiktionary uses [[WT:LANGCODE|language codes]] extensively for any language-specific purposes involving templates. For example, many templates use &lt;tt&gt;en&lt;/tt&gt; to refer to the English language, or &lt;tt&gt;cmn&lt;/tt&gt; to refer to Mandarin Chinese. Knowing the code of the language you are working on is very important, and necessary for almost any kind of editing on Wiktionary.
:* On Wiktionary, categories are often added to pages by the templates used on that page, so there is no need to put them directly on the page. In particular, [[Wiktionary:Headword-line templates|headword-line templates]] and context templates are most commonly used to add entries to the appropriate categories.

===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*preyH-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|free}}, {{m|enm|fre}}, {{m|enm|freo}}, from {{inh|en|ang|frēo||free}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*frī}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*frijaz||beloved, not in bondage}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*priHós||dear, beloved}}, from {{m|ine-pro|*preyH-||to love, please}}. Related to {{m|en|friend}}. Cognate with {{cog|fy|frij||free}}, {{cog|nl|vrij||free}}, {{cog|nds|free||free}}, {{cog|de|frei||free}}, {{cog|da|-}}, {{cog|sv|-}} and {{cog|no|fri||free}}, {{cog|sa|प्रिय|tr=priyá}}.

Germanic and Celtic are the only Indo-European language branches in which the PIE word with the meaning of &quot;dear, beloved&quot; acquired the additional meaning of &quot;free&quot; in the sense of &quot;not in bondage&quot;. This was an extension of the idea of &quot;characteristic of those who are dear and beloved&quot;, in other words friends and tribe members (in contrast to unfree inhabitants from other tribes and prisoners of war, many of which were among the slaves – compare the Latin use of [[liberi]] to mean both &quot;free persons&quot; and &quot;children of a family&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{R:Etymonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dwds.de/wb/frei &quot;frei&quot;] in Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb comes from {{inh|en|enm|freen}}, {{m|enm|freoȝen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|frēon}}, {{m|ang|frēoġan||to free; make free}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*frijōn}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*frijōną}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*preyH-}}.

While this Wiktionary is known as the English Wiktionary, it is still a matter of fundamental policy that this dictionary includes &quot;all words in all languages&quot;.  To the broad extent that this is applicable it necessitates that some articles will need to reflect the structure and peculiarities of the language in question at the moment. The pages listed in the category [[:Category:Wiktionary language considerations]] deal with how to manage entries in a specific language, or instances of words in that language on other pages.

There are some general issues that affect a wide range of languages. These include
*[[Wiktionary:Transliteration|Transliteration]]
*[[Wiktionary:Languages with more than one grammatical gender|Existence of more than one grammatical gender]]

===Noun===
{{en-noun|s|encyclopediae|encyclopediæ}}

# A [[comprehensive]] [[reference work]] (often spanning several printed volumes) with articles (usually arranged in alphabetical order, or sometimes arranged by category) on a range of [[subjects]], sometimes general, sometimes limited to a particular field.
#: {{ux|en|I only use the library for the '''encyclopedia''', as we’ve got most other books here.}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|cat}}, {{m|enm|catte}}, from {{inh|en|ang|catt||male cat}}, {{m|ang|catte||female cat}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*kattuz}}.
{{rel-top|Further etymology and cognates.}}
The Germanic word is generally thought to be from {{der|en|LL.|cattus||domestic cat}} (c. 350, [[w:Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]]), from {{der|en|la|catta}} (c. 75 {{small|A.D.}}, [[w:Martial|Martial]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{R:Etymonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; from an {{der|en|afa}} language. This would roughly match how domestic cats themselves spread, as genetic studies suggest they began to spread out of the [[Near East]] / [[Fertile Crescent]] during the Neolithic (being in Cyprus by 9500 years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;ISample&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COttoni&quot;/&gt; and Greece and Italy by 2500 years ago&lt;ref&gt;Dennis C. Turner, Patrick Bateson, ''The Domestic Cat: The Biology of its Behaviour'' ({{ISBN|1107512212}}), page 93&lt;/ref&gt;), especially after they became popular in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISample&quot;&gt;Ian Sample, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jun/29/genetics.sciencenews DNA research identifies homeland of the domestic cat]'', in ''The Guardian'' (29 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COttoni&quot;&gt;Claudio Ottoni, Wim Van Neer, Eva-Maria Geigl, et al, ''The palaeogenetics of cat dispersal in the ancient world'', in ''Nature: Ecology &amp; Evolution'', volume 1 (19 June 2017) (doi: 10.1038/s41559-017-0139); summarized e.g. by [https://web.archive.org/web/20180516020404/http://blogs.plos.org/onscienceblogs/2017/06/23/where-did-cats-come-from/ PLOS]&lt;/ref&gt; However, every proposed source word has presented problems. [[w:Adolphe Pictet|Adolphe Pictet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{R:ine:Pictet|vol=I|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many subsequent sources refer to [[w:Barabra|Barabra]] (Nubian) {{m|onw|tr=kaddîska}} and &quot;Nouba&quot; ([[w:Nobiin language|Nobiin]]) {{m|fia|kadīs}} as possible sources or cognates,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Keller, ''Die antike Tierwelt'', vol. 1: ''Säugetiere'' (Leipzig, 1909), 75; Walther von Wartburg, ed. ''[[w:Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch|Französisches etymologisches Wörterbuch]]'', vol. 2 (Basel: R. G. Zbinden, 1922–1967), 520.&lt;/ref&gt; but M. Lionel Bender says the Nubian word is a loan from {{noncog|ar|قِطَّة}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qitta&quot;&gt;John Huehnergard, “Qitta: Arabic Cats”, in ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'', ed. Beatrice Gruendler (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 407–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Paul Savignac suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of {{cog|cop|ϣⲁⲩ||tomcat}} suffixed with feminine {{m|egy|-t}},&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Savignac, ''Dictionnaire français-gaulois'', s.v. &quot;[[chat]]&quot; (Paris: Errance, 2004), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; but John Huehnergard says &quot;the source [...] was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Qitta&quot;/&gt;

It may be a [[Wanderwort]]&lt;ref&gt;{{R:EWddS|ed=22|hw=Katze|362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kroonen says the word must have existed in Germanic from a very early date, as it shows morphological alternations, and suggests that it might have been borrowed from Uralic, compare {{noncog|se|gađfe||female stoat}} and {{noncog|hu|hölgy||stoat; lady, bride}} from {{noncog|urj-pro|*käďwä||female (of a fur animal)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{R:gem:EDPG|*kattōn-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using public domain works as a base for Wiktionary: Several public domain works can be used for sourcing texts into Wiktionary. Webster's dictionary from 1913 is available in plain text online, convenient for copying and pasting. The Century Dictionary 1911 is available as DJVU online, and has to be manually retyped. Some volumes of Oxford English Dictionary are available as DJVU and have to be manually retyped. There are some other sources in public domain, such as 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue available in plain text.

==Webster 1913==

See also [[Wiktionary:Webster's Dictionary, 1913]]. Many definitions from ''Webster’s New International Dictionary of the English Language'', 1913, have been imported into Wiktionary (probably, as of August 2020, there are no more, or very few, definitions left to import, but the dictionary does also include etymologies, synonyms, and quotations). See also the template {{temp|Webster 1913}}, which is used for all Wiktionary pages that were imported from that dictionary (as of August 2020 there's a lot - a few thousand)

Available online for search at [https://www.websters1913.com/ websters1913.com]; available as one huge plain text file from [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29765 Project Gutenberg #29675].

For a past discussion from 2002 and 2003, see [[Wiktionary talk:Public domain sources|the talk page]].

==Century 1911==

''The Century Dictionary'', 1911 is a public domain dictionary available as DJVU from [http://www.global-language.com/CENTURY/ www.global-language.com]. It can be read with a DJVU plugin, but also without it in a JPEG version. It is in public domain per its being  published in the United States pre-1924.

==Oxford English Dictionary==

The first [[fascicle]] of the Oxford English Dictionary was published in 1884, and it was published in fascicles until completion in 1928. Oxford English Dictionary is a great source of word history.

Some scanned fascicles of Oxford English Dictionary under the title ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'' by James A. H. Murray can be found at archive.org, as seen in [http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22James%20A.%20H.%20Murray%22 works by James A. H. Murray]. They have been scanned by a person whose [http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2005-October/000794.html letter of intent] can be seen, as well as his [http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2006-March/000816.html progress] as of March 16 2006. He is scanning those fascicles published in the US before 1924, maybe because in the UK the copyright is [http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=16644 extended to author's life + 70 years]. There seem to be no plain text files converted using OCR.

The volume 1 of OED, 1884, is also available at Fractionary, starting at OED:1_1, and ending at OED:1_1240.

A number of scans are available through a [http://www.openwordbook.org web interface] as of 2012.

The online version is available [http://www.oed.com/loginpage here] using a UK library card number of the correct format (e.g. hertsb123456789).

==Roget's thesaurus 1911==
''Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases'' by Peter Mark Roget is a public domain thesaurus, organized around word clusters. See also {{temp|R:Roget 1911}}.

Available online for search at [http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/webster.form.html ARTFL Project]; further available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/22 gutenberg #22] and [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10681 gutenberg #10681].

A 1864 edition available at [http://books.google.com/books?id=j7kUAAAAYAAJ ''Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases'' at Google books].

A 1911 edition available at Google books, as [http://books.google.com/books?id=WCgFAQAAIAAJ ''Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases''], edited by C. O. Sylvester Mawson, 1911, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, New York

A 1922 revised edition ''Roget's International Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases'' by Christopher Orlando Sylvester Mawson, Peter Mark Roget, Thomas Y. Crowell company, should be in public domain per being published in the United States pre-1923. An online version is available at [http://www.bartleby.com/110/ Bartleby.com].

==Moby Thesaurus II==
Moby Thesaurus II is a public domain thesaurus created by Grady Ward, featuring a list of synonyms for each word. See also {{temp|R:Moby II}}.

==Allen's Synonyms and Antonyms==
''Allen's Synonyms and Antonyms'' by F. Sturges Allen, 1921, Harper &amp; Brothers, New York is a public domain dictionary of English synonyms and antonyms, available at [http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924055488716 archive.org]. Its being public domain follows from its being published in the United States before 1924; see also [[S:Help:Public domain]].

==Lewis and Short==
''A Latin Dictionary'' by Charlton T. Lewis &amp; Charles Short, 1879, is a PD Latin dictionary. See also {{temp|R:L&amp;S}}. Searchable online in [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dbonus Perseus Project, here &quot;bonus&quot;]. Available as scanned PDF and browsable online at [http://www.archive.org/details/LewisShortLatnDiccionary archive.org], as published at 1891.

=====Usage notes=====
In English and other languages with a tradition of space-delimited writing, it is customary to treat &quot;word&quot; as referring to any sequence of characters delimited by spaces. However, this is not applicable to languages such as [[Chinese]] and [[Japanese]], which are normally written without spaces, or to languages such as [[Vietnamese]], which are written with spaces delimiting [[syllable]]s.

In computing, the size (length) of a word, while being fixed in a particular machine or processor family design, can be different in different designs, for many reasons. See {{w|Word (computer architecture)}} for a full explanation.

# Abbreviation for [[pound-force]], a unit of force/weight. Using this abbreviation to describe pound-force is inaccurate and unscientific.

=====Usage notes=====
* Internationally, the &quot;pound&quot; has most commonly referred to the UK pound, £, (pound sterling). The other currencies were usually distinguished in some way, e.g., the &quot;Irish pound&quot; or the &quot;punt&quot;.
* In the vicinity of each other country calling its currency the pound among English speakers the local currency would be the &quot;pound&quot;, with all others distinguished, e.g., the &quot;British pound&quot;, the &quot;Egyptian pound&quot; etc.
* The general plural of &quot;pound&quot; has usually been &quot;pounds&quot; (at least since Chaucer), but the continuing use of the Old English genitive or neuter &quot;pound&quot; as the plural after numerals (for both currency and weight) is common in some regions. It can be considered correct, or colloquial, depending on region.

|passage=Economics is a messy discipline: too fluid to be a science, too rigorous to be an art. Perhaps it is fitting that economists’ most-used metric, gross domestic product ('''GDP'''), is a tangle too. '''GDP''' measures the total value of output in an economic territory. Its apparent simplicity explains why it is scrutinised down to tenths of a percentage point every month.}}

Supported by investments of time rather than money, it has left the old ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' in the dust – and taken the '''GDP''' down a few notches in the process.}}

[[File:Runic letter ansuz.png|thumb|100px|Runic letter {{m|mul||ᚫ|tr=a|ansuz}}, source for Anglo-Saxon Futhorc letters replaced by ''A'']]

===Etymology 1===
From {{der|en|enm|-}} and {{der|en|ang|-}} upper case letter {{m|enm|A}} and split of {{der|en|enm|-}} and {{der|en|ang|-}} upper case letter {{m|enm|Æ}}.
* The {{der|en|ang|-}} letters {{m|ang|A}} and {{m|ang|Æ}} replaced the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc letters {{m|mul|sc=Runr|ᚪ||tr=a|āc}} and {{m|mul|sc=Runr|ᚫ||tr=æ|æsc}}, derived from the Runic letter {{m|mul|sc=Runr|ᚫ||tr=a|Ansuz}}, in the 7th century.

===Etymology===
Borrowed from {{bor|la|grc|Α|t=alpha}}, likely through Etruscan.

===Pronunciation===
* {{la-IPA|ā|eccl=yes}}
* {{audio|la|La-ecc-A.ogg|audio (ecclesiastical)}}

===Letter===
{{la-letter|upper=A|lower=a}}

# {{lb|la|sometimes with ''[[littera]]''}} {{Latn-def|la|letter|1}}

====Usage notes====
* In compound words, long ''ā'' remains unchanged: {{m|la|lābor}}, {{m|la|dēlābor}}; {{m|la|āctus}}, {{m|la|perāctus}}. In an internal syllable, short ''ă'' is changed by {{w|vowel reduction}} into short ''ĭ'' in open syllables and before /ng/, or short ''ĕ'' in closed ones and before /r/ and /l/: {{m|la|faciō}}, {{m|la|perficiō}}, {{m|la|perfectus}}; {{m|la|tangō}}, {{m|la|contingō}}; {{m|la|parō}}, {{m|la|imperō}}. It remains unchanged in cases in which the word was coined later on or levelled through analogy: {{m|la|amō}}, {{m|la|adamō}}; {{m|la|patiēns}}, {{m|la|impatiēns}}; {{m|la|tractō}}, {{m|la|dētrectō}}, later {{m|la|dētractō}}.

==Latvian==
{{wikipedia|lang=lv}}

===Etymology===
Proposed in 1908 as part of the new Latvian spelling by the scientific commission headed by [[w:Kārlis Mīlenbahs|K. Mīlenbahs]], which was accepted and began to be taught in schools in 1909. Prior to that, Latvian had been written in German [[Fraktur]], and sporadically in [[Cyrillic]].

====Letter====

===Etymology 2===
From {{inh|lb|goh|ouga}}, from {{inh|lb|gem-pro|*augô}}, ultimately from {{der|lb|ine-pro|*h₃ekʷ-||eye; to see}}. The phonetic development in Luxembourgish is regular: Old High German ''-ou-'' becomes ''-ā-''; intervocalic ''-g-'' is lost; word-final short vowels are apocopated.

# [[eye]]

===Etymology 3===

==English==
The following tables show the [[Wiktionary:International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and the English pronunciation (enPR) or {{w|American Heritage Dictionary}} (AHD) symbols that are used to represent the various sounds of the {{w|English language}}. The sounds of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP, UK), [[General American]] pronunciation (GenAm, US), Canadian English (CanE), Australian English (AuE){{,}} and New Zealand English (NZE) are shown.

For vowels in other dialects, see Wikipedia's {{w|IPA chart for English}}.

:''An [[:Image:IPA Chart for English 2.png|image of an old version of these tables]] is available.''

===[[vowel|Vowels]]===
For a fuller list of dialects, see {{w|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects}}.

Non-rhotic dialects (RP, Australia, New Zealand) do not pronounce what was historically a syllable-final ''r''; instead they have a schwa ({{IPAchar|/ə/}} or, in NZ, {{IPAchar|/ɘ/}}), centering diphthong (ending in {{IPAchar|/ə̯/}}){{,}} or a long vowel (ending in {{IPAfont|ː}}). In addition to pronouncing syllable-final ''r'', the rhotic dialects (General American and Canadian) do not have a vowel length distinction, so none of their vowels end in the length symbol {{IPAfont|ː}}.

This vowel table lists both [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s.

In order to allow [[Module:syllables]] to count syllables, the disyllabic sequence {{IPAchar|/iə/}} must be transcribed with a period to mark the syllable break &amp;ndash; {{IPAchar|/i.ə/}} &amp;ndash; so that it will not be confused with the New Zealand diphthong {{IPAchar|/iə/}}.

{{IPAchar|/ɹ/}} in the vowel plus {{IPAchar|/ɹ/}} sequences is sometimes replaced with {{IPAchar|/ɚ/}}: {{IPAchar|/ðɛɚ/}} instead of {{IPAchar|/ðɛɹ/}}. In order to keep [[Module:syllables]] from counting {{IPAchar|/ɚ/}} as a syllable, add the non-syllabic diacritic: {{IPAchar|/ðɛɚ̯/}}.

====Fortis and lenis====
The so-called voiceless and voiced obstruents are more properly {{w|fortis and lenis}}. Each member of a fortis&amp;ndash;lenis pair is distinguished from the other by various articulatory and auditory features, but not consistently by voicing or lack of it.

In most dialects of English, the fortis (voiceless) stops and affricate {{IPAchar|/p t tʃ k/}} are always voiceless, and are aspirated ({{IPAchar|[pʰ tʰ tʃʰ kʰ]}}) at the beginning of a word and at the beginning of a stressed syllable: for example, RP ''today'' {{IPAchar|[tʰəˈdeɪ]}}, ''chain'' {{IPAchar|[tʃʰeɪn]}} and ''account'' {{IPAchar|[əˈkʰaʊnt]}}. Vowels and [[w:sonorant|sonorant]]s immediately preceding syllable final fortis obstruents are usually pronounced shorter than before lenis obstruents, as in [[bet|''b'''e'''t'']] vs. [[bed|''b'''e'''d'']] and [[bent|''be'''n'''t'']] vs. [[bend|''be'''n'''d'']]. This phenomenon is known as pre-fortis [[w:Clipping (phonetics)|clipping]].

The lenis (voiced) stops and affricate {{IPAchar|/b d dʒ ɡ/}} are always unaspirated. Lenis obstruents {{IPAchar|/b v ð d z dʒ ʒ ɡ/}} are often devoiced at the beginning or end of words, but are fully voiced between voiced vowels and sonorants.

The fortis&amp;ndash;lenis distinction is neutralized in a few cases.

Initial consonant clusters consisting of {{IPAchar|/s/}} and a stop (as in {{m|en|spill}}, {{m|en|still}}, {{m|en|skill}}) are typically analyzed as having a fortis stop, which agrees with the spelling, but may equally well be analyzed as having a lenis stop (i.e., {{m|en||*sbill}}, {{m|en||*sdill}}, {{m|en||*sgill}}). The stop is both voiceless and unaspirated, and there is no additional phonetic feature that establishes it as either fortis or lenis.

In addition, American English has a sound change known as intervocalic alveolar {{w|flapping}}, in which {{IPAchar|/t d/}} are both pronounced as an alveolar flap {{IPAchar|[ɾ]}} between vowels or liquids and when not at the beginning of a stressed syllable, and {{IPAchar|/nt/}} between vowels may be pronounced as a nasalized alveolar flap, {{IPAchar|[ɾ̃]}}. The fortis stop {{IPAchar|/t/}} loses its distinctive voicelessness, and essentially becomes lenis. Flapping causes {{m|en|latter}} and {{m|en|ladder}} to both be pronounced as {{IPAchar|[ˈɫæɾɚ]}}, and causes {{m|en|winter}} to be pronounced as {{IPAchar|[ˈwɪɾ̃ɚ]}}, similar to {{m|en|winner}} {{IPAchar|[ˈwɪ̃nɚ]}}.

{{shortcut|WT:FAQ}}

== Starting out ==
'''Q:''' How do I add a new word?

:'''A:''' You can find out at [[Help:Starting a new page]].

'''Q:''' Where is the alphabetical listing?

:'''A:''' Try using the search feature instead. [[Special:Allpages]] lists all of the pages in Wiktionary, including the utility pages in the Wiktionary: namespace. [[:Category:English lemmas]] gives an alphabetic listing of English entries in Wiktionary, and pages in [[:Category:Lemmas by language]] do the same for other languages.

'''Q:''' I’ve found a common word that is missing from Wiktionary, and thought of adding a seed entry. But it seems like you want fully grown entries or nothing! I’m not a lexicologist. I’m just someone who feels they can contribute some simple dictionary definitions. I don’t know anything about etymology, translations or whatever! In Wikipedia a lot of people are quite happy to come along and copy-edit, wikify etc. Does that apply here?

:'''A:''' Yes! Wiktionary is far from complete, but the wiki philosophy is just as strong. If a word does not exist on Wiktionary, add it. If you know nothing about etymology that’s fine; your humblest contribution is still better than nothing. Someone else can add the etymology later. The minimum you need to include is the language of the word, its [[part of speech]], and its meaning.

:However, if you are contributing a translation, it is important to know to which meaning of the word the translation applies.

'''Q:''' I’ve already done some work without signing up, but now I would like to create a username to have all my work shown as my own. How can I create a new username?

:'''A:''' Just click on the '''Create an account or log in''' link on the top right of every Wiktionary page or [[Special:Userlogin]].

'''Q:''' What are the characters in the logo?

:'''A:''' Clockwise: [[シ]], [[श]], [[말]], &lt;bdi&gt;[[ش]]&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi&gt;[[ש]]&lt;/bdi&gt;, [[维]], [[Ж]], [[λ]], [[W]].

== Pronunciation ==
'''Q:''' Is there a table indicating which IPA symbols make certain sounds?

:'''A.''' Near the top of a page, there should be a pronunciation section, like so:
::{{IPA|en|/ˈwɪkʃənrɪ/|/ˈwɪkʃəˌnɛri/}}
: Just follow the links.

'''Q:''' How do we type those symbols?

:'''A:''' When you are in the edit page you will see below the save buttons a box with many accented letters and a pull-down menu that reads “Latin/Roman”. Select “IPA and enPR” from the pull-down menu. (There isn’t an option for SAMPA as all SAMPA characters can be typed on an ordinary keyboard.) Position the text cursor where you want the symbol to be inserted, then click on the desired character.

'''Q:''' The IPA symbols are showing up as blocks in Internet Explorer, is there a way to fix this?

:'''A.''' The easiest way for Windows/Internet Explorer users is to make sure the font “Arial Unicode MS” is installed on your computer. Then, in Internet Explorer go to Tools/Internet Options.../General tab. Select the “Fonts...” button at the bottom. Make sure the “Language script” displays “Latin based”, then set the “Web Page Font” to “Arial Unicode MS”. Click OK twice to exit.

'''Q:''' I’ve tried the above, and it still doesn’t work. Any other ideas?

:'''A:''' Works fine when setting Skin to Classic, Nostalgica or MySkin on your Preferences side, but not with Skins Cologne Blue, MonoBook. Would be nice if somebody could fix this. Alternatively, try a different browser, such as Firefox, which displays these characters correctly.

'''Q:''' Are there any articles with sound pronunciation for the word? Is it possible for myself to record and submit a word pronunciation?

:'''A:''' Yes; any article on [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:audio|this list]] (of articles that reference Template:audio) has a pronunciation; you can make requests at [[Wiktionary:Pronunciation file requests]]. It's possible for anyone to record and submit pronunciations of words, but don't upload them here: they belong on Commons: so all the Wiktionaries can use them. For details see [[Help:Audio pronunciations]] and [[Commons:Pronunciation files requests]].

== Article format ==
'''Q:''' How do we format articles? Is there a standard format we should use?

:'''A:''' Guidelines for this can be seen at [[Wiktionary:Entry layout]]. The concepts on that page have varying levels of acceptability, and continue to evolve as new techniques are developed to deal with a wide array of challenges relating to different languages.

'''Q:''' Some people link to other words as they type a definition. Since every English word would eventually be listed on the Wiktionary, maybe someone could add a code (which perhaps could be turned off) that made [[every]] [[word]] [[link]] [[to]] [[its]] [[corresponding]] [[entry]].

:'''A:''' When an article is loaded the software checks each linking word to see if the article for the word exists, and it is marked in blue if it exists, red if it does not. It only takes a fraction of a second to check each word, but if more words are checked this time is cumulative. If '''every''' word is checked, it could cause serious slowdowns. This already happens in link-rich articles. How often does one really need a link to “[[the]]”?
: Also, it’s often clearer to link a compound word, or the root of a word, depending on the meaning.

== Real words ==
'''Q:''' That’s not a real word, is it?

:'''A:''' In general, Wiktionary does not concern itself with metaphysical abstractions like “realness”. We instead use a set of objective criteria for inclusion ([[WT:CFI]]), and a word may meet those requirements in a number of ways, such as through its use in multiple publications over an extended period of time.

== Writing definitions ==
'''Q:''' How should we go about writing definitions?

:'''A:''' In some respects writing a definition is an art. Begin by finding examples where the word is used, and distill a definition that would be accurate for '''all''' of the examples. It may very well be that a word can have more than one definition. You can then add the quotations as examples. See also [[Help:Writing definitions]] &amp; [http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Dictionary-Definition How to Write a Dictionary Definition].

'''Q:''' How shouldn’t we go about writing definitions?

:'''A:''' One should not simply copy without crediting the definitions from other dictionaries and glossaries.

'''Q:''' Can I use what I find in other dictionaries and glossaries? How? How much?

:'''A:''' Yes and no! Wiktionary should represent the language as it is used in practice, and that is best done through evidence of usage. Not all dictionaries provide this kind of evidence and may only reflect usages current at the time that the dictionary was published. The 1913 edition of Webster’s Dictionary is a popular freely available source, but it must be supplemented to show how some words have changed since 1913.

:There are copyright issues associated with more recent dictionaries. Also, specialized glossaries and other books may have the '''only''' accurate definition of a technical term, but they may be protected by copyright. [[fair use|Fair use]] (or fair dealing) is important here, and can apply as long as we don’t use too much from one source. Whenever we use a source in that way, it must be credited. The legal issues about this are very complex, and it is wise to find other ways of expressing yourself so that fair use will not need to be a factor.

== Limiting and/or ordering definitions ==

'''Q:''' To avoid bias, should we sometimes limit or order the definitions so as to avoid giving the impression that rare or difficult uses of a word are more common than they are?

:'''A:''' Yes, in theory, the oldest uses of a word should be listed first, but in the absence of historical data this is difficult to do. Furthermore, definitions are sometimes related, and should be close to each other in such circumstances. Determining which usage is most common or popular requires expressing a Point of View, and should be avoided. Links to Wikipedia or references to the Oxford English Dictionary are better ways to ensure that the definitions are complete.

'''Q:''' Is there a subset of the Wiktionary that would include only meanings that are known to be necessary for learning English as a second language, or for learning common English idioms?

:'''A:''' There is provision for this idea. If you have the time, you could consider participating in the separate project at [[:Simple:Main Page]] that aims to do just that! This kind of simplification is not a simple undertaking, and it has not attracted a lot of interest.

== Copyright infringement==

'''Q:''' I saw some copyrighted material in a certain article, submitted by user XYZ. What should I do?

:'''A:''' In a publication like ours it is never easy to determine when a copyright infringement has taken place. Fair use ''(see below)'' is not an infringement. If you suspect that an article contains copyrighted material, use the following steps:
:# Don’t panic, and do your homework.
:# On the talk page for the article show why you think it is a copyright violation. In particular show exactly where you think the text in question was originally published.
:# As a matter of courtesy, if the material was placed by a registered user, politely let him know about this on his talk page.
:# Add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{rfc}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the article and make a note at [[WT:RFC]]. There is no need to immediately remove the suspected material.

'''Q:''' What is copyright?

:'''A:''' Copyright is a person’s exclusive economic right to use and exploit his own creative and artistic productions. Its duration depends primarily on the laws of the country in which that person lives. It may be accompanied by moral rights such as the right to be properly credited for one’s works. A work whose copyright has expired is said to be in the public domain.

'''Q:''' What is fair use?

:'''A:''' In simple terms, “[[fair use]]” (also known as “fair dealing” or “fair practice”) is the allowable quotation of the copyrighted works of others. The concept is not relevant to works that are already in the public domain. Any such quotation '''must''' be properly credited. Whether any particular quotation constitutes fair use can often be a very difficult matter to resolve. In most cases, quoting a single definition or a brief illustrative passage from any author’s work will fall within the definition of fair use.

== Namespaces ==

'''Q:''' Occasionally in a discussion I see a reference to a “namespace”. What is that?

:'''A:''' A namespace is a group of pages designed to fulfill a special purpose. Namespaces are denoted by a prefix followed by a colon, as [[Talk:color]]. The one exception to that is the “article” namespace, which contains the substantive articles for the Wiktionary; it has no prefix. See [[Help:Namespace]] for more information. Articles in a namespace are also sorted and searched separately from those in other namespaces. Articles in different namespaces may have identical names after the prefix.

'''Q:''' Where can I see a list of active namespaces?

:'''A:''' See [[Wiktionary:Namespace]] or [[Special:Allpages]]. Currently, they are “(articles)”, “Talk”, “User”, “User talk”, “Wiktionary”, “Wiktionary talk”, “Image”, “Image talk”, “MediaWiki”, “MediaWiki talk”, “Template”, “Template talk”, “Help”, “Help talk”, “Category”, “Category talk”, “Appendix”, “Appendix talk”, “Index”, “Index talk”, “Thesaurus”, “Thesaurus talk”, “Concordance”, “Concordance talk”, “Rhymes”, “Rhymes talk”, “Transwiki”, “Transwiki talk”, “Citations”, “Citations talk”.

'''Q:''' Is it possible to restrict a search to a given namespace?

:'''A:''' Yes, [[Special:Allpages]] allows you to search individual namespaces.

== Wiktionary in your language ==

'''Q:''' What should I do if I want to start a Wiktionary in my own language?

:'''A:''' You should go to the [[m:requests for new languages|requests for new languages]] page on Meta.

== Referencing Wiktionaries from Other Wikipedias ==

'''Q:''' What is Transwiki?

:'''A:''' Transwiki is a way of moving articles from one wiki to another (in the case of Wiktionary, especially from Wikipedia to Wiktionary). It essentially applies to articles that have been written in the wrong project. By putting the article in the namespace “Transwiki:” the transferor can park it there without concern about our format or whether we will even accept it.

'''Q:''' Are &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wiktionary:Dog]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wiktionary:eo:Konduto]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; suitable references from other Wikipedias to Wiktionaries?

:'''A:''' From a Wikipedia, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wiktionary:Dog]] or the shorter [[wikt:Dog]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; should link to the Wiktionary in the same language.

:From Wiktionary, a link beginning with the word ''Wiktionary'' is treated as a link to the page in the ''Wiktionary namespace'' with the title &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wiktionary:dog]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Upper or lower case of the first letter of the article title may give different results in this Wiktionary (see [[m:Help:Page_name#Case-sensitivity_of_the_first_character|here]] for the status of this on other Wiktionaries). In the same way, here the link &lt;nowiki&gt; [[wikipedia:Dog]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; will link to wikipedia.

== What is a template? ==

'''Q:''' What is a Wiktionary template?

:'''A:''' The word '''template''' in Wiktionary jargon means an entry in the Template: namespace which substitutes the content of the template whenever it is addressed in an article.

'''Q:''' How does it work?

:'''A:''' Someone devises a template such as [[template:Wikipedia]]. Then, others use it by adding the text &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipedia}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; into their articles. When anyone displays that article, the text from [[template:Wikipedia]] is ''included in that page''. In this example the template produces a box that includes a link to the article with the same name in Wikipedia.

'''Q:''' Where can I find a list of these templates?

:'''A:''' See [[Wiktionary:Index to templates]].

== Examples ==

'''Q:''' Should I add examples to each definition?

:'''A:''' Examples are good, but [[Wiktionary:Quotations|quotations]] are much better. A well-chosen quotation can do everything that an example can, and additionally show evidence
:* of the age of a word,
:* that the meaning given reflects actual use, and
:* that the word isn’t just made up for Wiktionary.

== Log in ==
'''Q:''' If I have an account with Wikipedia, do I still have to create a new account with Wiktionary?

:'''A:''' No, provided you have accepted the Single log-in, you can keep the same username throughout all Wikimedia projects.

== Wikifying ==

'''Q:''' What is wikifying/wikification?

:'''A:''' Putting two square brackets before and after a term will auto-generate a hypertext markup language link to that word’s page, here on Wiktionary. Thus, entering &lt;nowiki&gt;[[link]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will give [[link]].

'''Q:''' [[why|Why]] [[don't|don’t]] [[we]] [[wikify]] [[every]] [[word]]? [[that|That]] [[would]] [[be]] [[so]] [[cool]]!

:'''A:''' We don’t for several reasons:
:* Logical continuity. The wikilinks are meant to help clarify aspects of a meaning; it’s good to have the important words stand out.
:* Server performance. The computers must check every word that’s linked like that. It’s no big deal on a short article, but it really slows down the downloading of longer articles.
:* If you really, really want something like this, you should add Wiktionary to the list of search engines in your browser. This way you will be able to select a word, right-click it and look it up on Wiktionary. Also, this will work on any website—not just Wiktionary!

'''Q:''' Fine then. [[Hey, look]]—a red link! Should I dewikify it?

:'''A:''' Maybe, but usually, '''no!''' Red links let you know where there is work yet to be done. They also help new users understand that they can help out here too.

'''Q:''' Any other guidelines on what to wikify?

:'''A:''' The following are but a few.
:*On the inflection line, (the line following the part-of-speech header) you should wikify '''all''' component words of idioms and phrases.
:*You should wikify all translated words.
:*You should wikify the expansion of abbreviations. Usually the main article should go with the short form’s ''expansion entry'', not the abbreviation itself.
:*All foreign language words in the etymology section should be wikified.
:*All foreign languages in the etymology section should be wikified.
:*All inflections of a word should be wikified (plurals, comparatives, superlatives, third person, participles and past tenses.)
:*None of the words in example sentences or quotations should be wikified. The headword of the entry should be bolded, within example sentences and quotations.

== Downloading Wiktionary ==

'''Q:''' Is it possible to download Wiktionary?

:'''A:''' Yes. https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/ should have the latest copy of the main namespace. The cleanest navigation page is https://dumps.wikimedia.org/. Just download a *-articles.xml.bz2 file and some software to read it ([[meta:Data_dumps#Wikipedia_Dump_Reader|for *nix]], [[meta:Data_dumps/Other_tools#BzReader_(Windows_offline_reader)|for Windows]]).
&lt;!-- This ConradIrwin tool is 503/not maintained-missing in action
:If you just want definitions, you can try http://tools.wmflabs.org/enwiktdefns/. --&gt;

'''Q:''' Can I use data from Wiktionary in my program?

:'''A:''' As long as you meet the conditions of the [[w:GFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]] or [[wiktionary:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License|Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License]], certainly.

== How do I batch upload? ==

'''Q:''' Hi, I have a bunch of words in ''language'' that I can upload, already containing the word, grammatical tags and basic English translation. However, how would I do a batch upload, since I don’t have the kind of time to enter each one separately?

:'''A:''' The robot code in question is from the [[meta:Using the python wikipediabot|Using the Python Wikipediabot]]’s {{monospace|pagefromfile.py}}.

:Example: dict.txt

&lt;pre&gt;
'''Mangaung'''
{{-start-}}
==Sotho==

===Proper noun===
{{head|st|proper noun}}

# [[Bloemfontein]]
{{-stop-}}
'''kgòtsò'''
{{-start-}}
==Sotho==

===Noun===
{{head|st|noun}}

# [[peace]]
{{-stop-}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

:Remember to learn the Wiktionary format of entries before starting. It will correctly run “throttled” by default. Start with ten entries. When you get ten to load correctly, try running one hundred ''then stop'' and check the results; make sure you haven’t been blocked for flooding and none of your entries have been edited already. If any have been edited, you don’t have the format correct and need to fix the problem before testing again.

:Request bot status in the [[WT:BP|Beer parlour]] if you get complaints. If entries are not marked minor by default, go to [[Special:Preferences]], [Editing] and check off “Mark all edits minor by default”.

'''Q:''' What if someone keeps posting messages on my talk page, saying I’m uploading them wrong?

:'''A:''' Stop what you are doing. Ask for help on [[WT:ID|Wiktionary’s information desk]].

== How do I link to Wikipedia? ==

{{wikipedia|Wikipedia:How to edit a page#Links and URLs}}
In general, we should have terms defined locally here. But in a definition, if you need to refer to the corresponding Wikipedia entry there are three common methods:
* When referencing Wikipedia ''outside'' of a definition, you can simply use the inter-project prefix &lt;code&gt;w:&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:WP:FAQ|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = [[w:WP:FAQ|WP:FAQ]], or the template {{temp|w|WP:FAQ}}. Other useful interproject links to know are &lt;code&gt;s:&lt;/code&gt; for linking to [[s:|Wikisource]] documents used for quotations, and of course you may use &lt;code&gt;wikt:&lt;/code&gt; to link to Wiktionary from other sister projects. Note that interproject links do not work in redirects.
* When Wikipedia has one or more articles about a word or phrase, you can add {{temp|pedia}} in a “Further reading” section at the end of the entry, just before the categories:
&lt;pre&gt;
===Further reading===
* {{pedia}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
:This produces:
::*{{projectlink|wikipedia|Help:FAQ}}
:See [[Template talk:pedia]] for more information.
* You can also add the template {{temp|wikipedia}} at the top of the language section, which adds a “fancy” sister project link box.

== Why do you block new editors so readily? ==
As said at the top of [[Help:Interacting with other users]], “Actions that appear destructive are either a result of someone not caring, not understanding, or not concentrating. Those who don’t care should be blocked lest they cause damage, those who don’t understand should be educated, and accidental damage should be undone.” Allowing someone who doesn’t care about Wiktionary to edit it is a waste of everyone’s time, as is giving warnings to people who will not take them on board.

== How and why was I prevented from publishing my changes to a page? ==

Wiktionary uses [[:MW:Extension:AbuseFilter|abuse filters]] ([[Special:AbuseFilter]]) to automatically identify certain edits as being probably vandalism, and prevent them from being made. Any text you try to add is saved in a log ([[Special:AbuseLog]]) which administrators can access, so if you believe your edit was not vandalism, you can request at the [[Wiktionary:Information desk]] that an administrator look into it.

== Why can’t I see words like “[[ads]]”, “[[Facebook]]” or “[[Twitter]]” in some entries? ==

Some ad-blockers censor these words. For instance, with an ad-blocker turned on, you may not be able to see the word “twitter” in the first definition for the word {{m|zh|呢喃}}—the first definition will end with the word “to”. &lt;!--See e.g. [[Wiktionary:Grease_pit/2018/December#The_word_'twitter'_does_not_display_properly_on_the_page_呢喃]].--&gt; Or, you may not be able to see the content of the entry “[[ads]]” or “[[advert]]”. In most cases whitelisting “wiktionary.org” or temporarily disabling any ad-blockers you use will fix this but following an issue in April 2019, Wiktionary was whitelisted on a system used by major ad blockers.&lt;ref&gt;[[meta:Tech/20190404-Adblock-issue]]&lt;/ref&gt; If the issue persists, make a post in the [[Wiktionary:Grease pit]].

== What is &quot;Lua error: not enough memory&quot;? ==

This is a well-known technical issue that currently affects some larger entries; no universal solution is currently known. [[Wiktionary:Lua memory errors]] discusses this issue in further detail.

&lt;!-- note: the links will be invalid if the project namespaces will change in other languages --&gt;

{{policy-VOTE|vote=&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-03/Vote requirements for policy changes]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{shortcut|WT:EL|WT:ELE|WT:MOS}}

This is a list of norms that govern how an entry should be formatted. This includes what sections are allowed and what contents are expected to be found in them. These rules reflect what editors think as best concerning the standard format of an entry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-12/EL introduction]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flexibility==
While the information below may represent some kind of “standard” form, it is not a set of rigid rules. You may experiment with deviations, but other editors may find those deviations unacceptable, and revert those changes. They have just as much right to do that as you have to make them. Be ready to discuss those changes. If you want your way accepted, you have to make the case for that. Unless there is a good reason for deviating, the standard should be presumed correct. Refusing to discuss, or engaging in edit wars may also affect your credibility in other unrelated areas.

==Basics==

===A very simple example===
This is a simple entry for the word '''bed''', and shows the most fundamental elements of an entry:

&lt;/pre&gt;

===Variations for languages other than English===
Entries for terms in other languages should follow the standard format as closely as possible regardless of the language of the word. However, a translation into English should normally be given instead of a definition, including a gloss to indicate which meaning of the English translation is intended. Also, the translations section should be omitted.

For languages written in other scripts (Japanese, Gothic, etc.), we have [[romanization]] systems in place. It is required that each romanization entry contain at least one definition line starting with “#” in the wikitext.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2013-03/Romanization and definition line]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages do have characteristics that require variation from the standard format. For links to these variations see [[Wiktionary:Language considerations]].

==List of headings==
There are additional headings which you should include if possible, but if you don’t have the necessary expertise, resources or time, you have no obligation to add them, with the possible exception of “References”. The list below is not an exclusive list; other headings may be essential in some circumstances. An order for these headings is recommended, but variations in that order are also allowable.

A typical entry that uses many of these additional headings could be formatted thus:&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2008-12/Amending ELE example entry]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-07/Alternative forms header]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key principle in ordering the headings and indentation levels is nesting. The order shown above accomplishes this most of the time. A heading placed at one level includes everything that follows until an equivalent level is encountered. If a word can be a noun and a verb, everything that derives from its being the first chosen part of speech should be put before the second one is started. Nesting is a key principle to the organization of Wiktionary, but the concept suffers from being difficult to describe with verbal economy. If you have problems with this, examine existing entries, or ask questions of a more senior person.

===Headings before the definitions===
In general, headings in this group do not depend on the meaning of the word. They give an environment that leads up to the word and its relation to other words, and allow us to distinguish it from others that may be similar in some respects. Order of headings:

* '''Alternative forms'''&lt;ref name=&quot;altforms&quot;&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-09/Placement of &quot;Alternative forms&quot; 2 (weaker proposal)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Description'''&lt;ref name=&quot;description&quot;&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2016-08/Description]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Glyph origin'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2017-02/Glyph origin]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Etymology'''
* '''Pronunciation''' (or '''Production''' for sign language entries)

===Headings after the definitions===
These headings generally derive from knowing the meaning of the word. Order of headings:

*'''Usage notes'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2016-02/Placement of &quot;Usage notes&quot;]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Reconstruction notes'''&lt;ref name=&quot;recons&quot;/&gt;
*'''Inflection''', '''Declension''' or '''Conjugation'''
*'''Mutation'''
*'''Quotations''' (when not given under a particular sense)
*'''Alternative forms'''&lt;ref name=&quot;altforms&quot;/&gt;
*'''Alternative reconstructions'''&lt;ref name=&quot;recons&quot;&gt;{{section link|Wiktionary:Beer parlour/2019/November#Include &quot;Reconstruction notes&quot; and &quot;Alternative reconstructions&quot; in WT:EL?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Anagrams'''

==Contents==

===Entry name===
The name of the entry is the term, phrase, symbol, morpheme or other lexical unit being defined.&lt;ref name=&quot;entryname&quot;&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-10/Entry name section]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For languages with two cases of script, the entry name usually begins with a lowercase letter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2005-03/First letter capitalization]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, use {{m|en|work}} for the English noun and verb, not {{m|en||Work}}. Words which begin with a [[Appendix:Capital letter|capital letter]] in running text are exceptions. Typical examples include proper nouns ({{m|en|Paris}}, {{m|en|Neptune}}), German nouns ({{m|de|Brot}}, {{m|de|Straße}}), and many abbreviations ({{m|en|PC}}, {{m|en|DIY}}). If someone tries to access the entry with incorrect capitalization, the software will try to redirect to the correct page automatically.

For prefixes, suffixes and other morphemes in most languages, place the character “-” where it links with other words: {{m|en|pre-}}, {{m|en|-ation}}, {{m|en|-a-}}, etc.

Some page titles can’t be created because of restrictions in the software, usually because they contain certain symbols such as [[Unsupported titles/Number sign|#]] or [[Unsupported titles/Vertical line|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;]], or are too long. The full list of those entries is at [[Appendix:Unsupported titles]]. They are named using the descriptive format “[[Unsupported titles/Number sign]]”, while using [[JavaScript]] to show the correct title like a normal entry.

For names of matched-pair entries such as [[( )]] and [[* *]], see {{section link|Wiktionary:Matched-pair entries#Entry name}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;pair&quot;&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-09/Matched-pair entries — policy page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For names of sign language entries, see {{section link|Wiktionary:About sign languages#Entry name}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-12/Entry name: sign languages]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Before the first language section===
When multiple capitalizations, punctuation, diacritics, ligatures, scripts and combinations with numbers and other symbols exist, such as {{m|en|pan}} (as in “frying pan”), {{m|en|Pan}} (the Greek god), {{m|en|pan-}} (meaning “all-”) and {{m|ja|パン|tr=pan}} (Japanese for “bread”), use the template {{temp|also}} at the top of the page to cross-link between them: {{temp|also|Pan|PAN|pan-|Pan-}}. When there are too many variations, place them in a separate appendix page, in this case [[Appendix:Variations of &quot;pan&quot;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;entryname&quot;/&gt;

===Language===
* Each entry has one or more L2 (level-two) language sections. For example, the entry {{m|und|sea}} has different meanings in English and Spanish, both on the same page.
* For languages that have multiple names, a single name is chosen that should be used throughout Wiktionary. Typically, this is an English name for the language. See [[Wiktionary:Languages]] for more information.
* Priority is given to Translingual: this heading includes terms that remain the same in all languages. This includes taxonomic names, symbols for the chemical elements, and abbreviations for international units of measurement; for example {{m|mul|Homo sapiens}}, {{m|mul|He||helium}}, and {{m|mul|km||kilometre}}. English comes next, because this is the English Wiktionary. After that come other languages in alphabetical order.
* Language sections should be separated from each other by a horizontal line, generated with four dashes (----).&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-12/Language]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part of speech===
{{shortcut|WT:POS}}
The [[part of speech]] ([[POS]]) is a descriptor like “Noun” or “Adjective”; they are different types of terms, phrases, symbols, morphemes and other lexical units on Wiktionary. Each entry has one or more POS sections. In each, there is a headword line, followed by the definitions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-12/Part of speech]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowed POS headers:

* Parts of speech: ''Adjective'', ''Adverb'', ''Ambiposition'', ''Article'', ''Circumposition'', ''Classifier'', ''Conjunction'', ''Contraction'', ''Counter'', ''Determiner'', ''Ideophone'', ''Interjection'', ''Noun'', ''Numeral'', ''Participle'', ''Particle'', ''Postposition'', ''Preposition'', ''Pronoun'', ''Proper noun'', ''Verb''
* Morphemes: ''Circumfix'', ''Combining form'', ''Infix'', ''Interfix'', ''Prefix'', ''Root'', ''Suffix''
* Symbols and characters: ''Diacritical mark'', ''Letter'', ''Ligature'', ''Number'', ''Punctuation mark'', ''Syllable'', ''Symbol''
* Phrases: ''Phrase'', ''Proverb'', ''Prepositional phrase''&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-01/Allow &quot;Prepositional phrase&quot; as a POS header]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Han]] characters and language-specific varieties: ''Han character'', ''Hanzi'', ''Kanji'', ''Hanja''
* ''Romanization''

Other headers can be proposed as new additions to the list. The use of nonstandard POS headers may cause an entry to be categorized in a cleanup category for further inspection.

Some POS headers are explicitly disallowed:

* ''Abbreviation'', ''Acronym'', ''Initialism''
* “(POS) form”: ''Verb form'', ''Noun form'', etc.
* “(POS) phrase”: ''Noun phrase'', ''Verb phrase'', etc. (with the exception of ''Prepositional phrase'')
* “(attribute) (POS)”: ''Transitive verb'', ''Personal pronoun'', etc. (with the exception of ''Proper noun'')
* “(POS) (number)”: ''Noun 1'', ''Noun 2'', etc.
* ''Cardinal number'', ''Ordinal number'', ''Cardinal numeral'', ''Ordinal numeral'' (note that ordinal numbers like {{l|en|first}} are classified as adjectives but put in [[:Category:English ordinal numbers]] by a template and fractions like {{l|en|seven eighths}} are nouns, and are added to [[:Category:English fractional numbers]] by a template)
* ''Clitic'', ''Gerund'', ''Idiom''

===Headword line===
The headword line&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2010-12/Renaming categories for inflection or headword templates]]&lt;/ref&gt; is the line directly below the part of speech header, in which the word is repeated, along with a romanization if applicable. You can use either the generic template {{temp|head}} or language-specific templates, such as {{temp|en-noun}} for English nouns. In some languages, additional information such as genders and inflected forms are found in the headword line.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-12/Headword line 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* For an overview of templates used, see {{section link|Wiktionary:Templates#Headword-line templates}}.
* For examples in English entries, see {{section link|Wiktionary:English entry guidelines#Headword-line templates}}.

===Definitions===
{{see also|{{section link|Wiktionary:Style guide#Definitions}}}}

The definitions are in the POS section, below the headword line. The definitions are organized as a numbered list. The numbers are generated by adding the number sign (#) at the start of each definition in the wikitext. The key terms of a definition should be linked to the respective entries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-08/Definitions — introduction]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2006-12/form-of style|2006-12/form-of style]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2010-08/Italicizing use-with-mention|2010-08/Italicizing use-with-mention]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

For definitions concerning matched-pair entries and their components, see {{section link|Wiktionary:Matched-pair entries#Definitions and redirects}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;pair&quot;/&gt;

====Abbreviations====
For abbreviations, acronyms and initialisms (such as {{m|en|PC}} and {{m|en|SNAFU}}), the definitions usually use templates linking to the expanded forms of the abbreviation. For example, one of the senses in the entry {{m|en|PC}} may be a template that displays “Initialism of [[personal computer]].” Do not capitalise words in the expanded form unless that is how the expanded form is usually written. (In the previous example, don’t write “[[personal computer|Personal Computer]]”.) Where the expanded form is an entry that exists (or should exist) in Wiktionary, link to it. Otherwise, if an appropriate Wikipedia article exists, link to it. When the expanded form does not merit either a Wiktionary entry or a Wikipedia article, link it to its component words. You may expand the definition with a [[gloss]] if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-11/Abbreviations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Context labels====
A context label identifies '''a definition which only applies in a restricted context'''. Such labels indicate, for example, that the following definition occurs in a limited geographic region or temporal period, or is used only by specialists in a particular field and not by the general population. Many context label templates also place an entry into a relevant category, but they must not be used merely for categorization (see [[#Category links|category links]], below). One or more labels may be placed before the definition:

{| style=&quot;margin-bottom: 1em;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;text-align:left; font-weight:normal; padding-right:1.5em;&quot; | wikitext
! style=&quot;text-align:left; font-weight:normal; padding-right:1.5em;&quot; | result
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;width:50%; padding-right:1.5em; font-family:monospace;&quot; |
&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{temp|lb|en|informal}} &lt;nowiki&gt;An [[informant]] or [[snitch]].&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| style=&quot;padding-right:1.5em;&quot; | 
# {{lb|en|informal}} An [[informant]] or [[snitch]].
|}

Details in [[Wiktionary:Context labels]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2009-03/Context labels in ELE v2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example sentences===
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Example sentences]]''
&lt;section begin=&quot;exampleSentences&quot; /&gt;
Generally, every definition should be accompanied by one or more [[Wiktionary:Quotations|quotations]] illustrating that definition. Quotations are supplemented by example sentences, which are devised by Wiktionary editors in order to illustrate definitions. Example sentences should:
:*be grammatically complete sentences, beginning with a capital letter and ending with a period, question mark, or exclamation point.
:*be placed immediately &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the applicable numbered definition, and &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; any quotations associated with that specific definition.
:*be ''italicized'', with the defined term '''boldfaced'''.
:*be as brief as possible while still clarifying the sense of the term. (In rare cases, examples consisting of two brief sentences may work best.)
:*be indented using the “&lt;code&gt;#:&lt;/code&gt;” command placed at the start of the line.
:*for languages in non-Latin scripts, a transcription is to be given in the line below, with an additional level of indentation: “&lt;code&gt;#::&lt;/code&gt;”.
:*for languages other than English, a translation is to be given in the line below (i.e. below the sentence or below the transcription), with an additional level of indentation: “&lt;code&gt;#::&lt;/code&gt;”, and with the translation of the defined term '''boldfaced'''.
:* '''not''' contain wikilinks (the words should be easy enough to understand without additional lookup).

The goal of the example sentences is the following, which is to be kept in mind when making one up:
:# To place the term in a context in which it is likely to appear, addressing level of formality, dialect, etc.
:# To provide notable [[collocation]]s, particularly those that are not idiomatic.
:# To select scenarios in which the meaning of the example itself is clear.
:# To illustrate the meaning of the term to the extent that a definition is obtuse.
:# To exemplify varying grammatical frames that are well understood, especially those that may not be obvious, for instance relying on collocation with a preposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-07/Layout of example sentences]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;exampleSentences&quot; /&gt;

===Alternative forms===
{{shortcut|WT:ALTER}}
Some variations of the same word kept in multiple pages include:

* regional variations: {{l|en|color}}, {{l|en|colour}}; {{l|en|center}}, {{l|en|centre}}
* historical variations: {{l|en|anæmia}}, {{l|en|anaemia}}; {{l|en|coördinate}}, {{l|en|coordinate}}
* hyphenization/compounds: {{l|en|tea cup}}, {{l|en|tea-cup}}, {{l|en|teacup}}
* style variation: {{l|en|naiveté}}, {{l|en|naïveté}}
* uncertain capitalization: {{l|en|laser}}, {{l|en|LASER}}
* different scripts: {{l|sh|реч}}, {{l|sh|reč}} (Serbo-Croatian for {{l|en|word}})&lt;ref name=&quot;entryname&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-12/Entry name section 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
The “Description” section is placed in entries for symbols, containing a visual description of the current symbol.

Section contents:
# The visual description should be as short as possible. Just using the name from the Unicode codepoint should usually be enough for the character description.
#* The entry [[⌛]] (Unicode name: &lt;code&gt;HOURGLASS&lt;/code&gt;) may be described as “An [[hourglass]].”
# When the Unicode codepoint name does not tell anything about the character shape, a short shape description may be added in one’s own words.
#* The entry [[🔗]] (Unicode name: &lt;code&gt;LINK SYMBOL&lt;/code&gt;) may be described as “Two or three [[interlocked]] [[chain]] [[link]]s.”
# Major rendering variations may be mentioned.
#* The entry [[🏦]] (Unicode name: &lt;code&gt;BANK&lt;/code&gt;) may mention: “This is sometimes [[render]]ed as a bank [[emoji]], or just the written word ‘bank’.”&lt;ref name=&quot;description&quot;/&gt;

===Etymology===
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Etymology]]''

The first header below the language heading is usually the level 3 “Etymology” header. The etymology is given right below the header without indentation. Etymology essentially shows where the word comes from. This may show the forms in other languages that underlie the word. For many modern words it may show who coined the word. If a word is derived from another in the same language by a regular rule, such as formation of an English adverb by adding “ly”, it is not necessary to repeat the complete details of the word’s origin on the page for the derived word.&lt;ref name=2010-08/&gt;

Sometimes two [[word]]s with different etymologies belong in the same entry because they are spelled the same (they are homographs). In such a case there will be more than one “Etymology” header, which we number. Hence for a word like ''[[lead]]'' the basic header skeleton looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
===Etymology 1===
====Pronunciation====
====Noun====
===Etymology 2===
====Pronunciation====
====Noun====
====Verb====
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the case of multiple etymologies, all subordinate headers need to have their levels increased by 1 in order to comply with the fundamental concept of showing dependence through nesting.

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-10/style for mentioned terms|2007-10/style for mentioned terms]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

===Pronunciation===
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Pronunciation]]''

The “Pronunciation” section includes the transcriptions, audio pronunciations, rhymes, hyphenations and homophones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-07/Pronunciation 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The region or accent ({{temp|a|GA}}, {{temp|a|RP}}, {{temp|a|Australia}}, ''et al.'') is first if there is regional variation, followed by the name of the transcription system, then a colon, then the transcription. It is preferable to use an established transcription system, such as enPR&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-02/Renaming AHD]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-02/Renaming AHD (run-off)]]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] (see [[Wiktionary:English pronunciation key|Wiktionary:Pronunciation key]] for an outline of these two systems). Phonemic transcriptions are normally placed between diagonal strokes (&lt;code&gt;[[:/ /]]&lt;/code&gt;), and phonetic transcriptions between square brackets (&lt;code&gt;{{unsupported|[ ]}}&lt;/code&gt;).
* For audio pronunciations, upload the Ogg file to [[:commons:Main Page|Commons]] and link to it using {{temp|audio}} or a similar template.
* Rhymes are listed in the “Rhymes” namespace. Do not list rhymes in the entry; instead, add a link to the respective rhymes page using {{temp|rhymes}}. See the template for usage instructions.
* Use the template {{temp|hyphenation}} to list hyphenation patterns.
* Homophones are words in the same language that have the same sound. (Avoid using the ambiguous term {{m|en|homonym}}, as it can mean either {{m|en|homophone}} or {{m|en|homograph}}.) Do not add: 1) words that are “nearly” homophones or rhymes (for example, for {{m|en|right}}, do not add {{m|en|white}} or {{m|en|light}}); 2) words that are homophones if they are mispronounced in some way (e.g. for {{m|en|miss}}, do not add {{m|en|myth}}); 3) words from other languages (which are unlikely to be true homophones anyway). Homophones are listed in alphabetical order using the {{temp|homophones}} template. If a word is a homophone in a particular dialect, it may be added provided the dialect is indicated (for example, {{m|en|latter}} is a homophone of {{m|en|ladder}} in accents with [[flapping]], and {{m|en|farther}} is a homophone of {{m|en|father}} in some [[non-rhotic]] accents).

A typical pronunciation section may look like the following (simplified) example based on the word {{m|en|symbol}}:

&lt;pre&gt;
* {{IPA|en|/ˈsɪmbəl/}}
* {{audio|en|en-us-symbol.ogg|Audio (US)}}
* {{rhymes|en|ɪmbəl}}
* {{hyphenation|en|sym|bol}}
* {{homophones|en|cymbal}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* {{IPA|en|/ˈsɪmbəl/}}
* {{audio|en|en-us-symbol.ogg|Audio (US)}}
* {{rhymes|en|ɪmbəl}}
* {{hyphenation|en|sym|bol}}
* {{homophones|en|cymbal}}

Example with multiple accents (see entry {{m|en|portmanteau}}):
&lt;pre&gt;
* {{a|RP}} {{IPA|en|/pɔːtˈmæn.təʊ/}}
* {{a|US}} {{enPR|pôrtmă'ntō}}, {{IPA|en|/pɔɹtˈmæntoʊ/}}; {{enPR|pô'rtmăntōʹ}}, {{IPA|en|/ˌpɔɹtmænˈtoʊ/}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* {{a|RP}} {{IPA|en|/pɔːtˈmæn.təʊ/}}
* {{a|US}} {{enPR|pôrtmă'ntō}}, {{IPA|en|/pɔɹtˈmæntoʊ/}}; {{enPR|pô'rtmăntōʹ}}, {{IPA|en|/ˌpɔɹtmænˈtoʊ/}}

Examples with homophones depending on the dialect (see entries {{m|en|ladder}} and {{m|en|father}}, respectively):
&lt;pre&gt;
* {{homophones|en|latter}} {{q|in accents with [[flapping]]}}
* {{homophones|en|farther}} {{q|in [[non-rhotic]] accents}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* {{homophones|en|latter}} {{q|in accents with [[flapping]]}}
* {{homophones|en|farther}} {{q|in [[non-rhotic]] accents}}

===Usage notes===
* These notes should not take the place of context labels when those are adequate for the job.
* Describe how a term is used, rather than trying to dictate how it should be used from your point of view.
* Curb the tendency to be long-winded in this section; brief explicit notes tend to be more effective.
* When mentioning entries in running text, use the {{temp|m}} template, which italicizes entries written in Latin script.
* Be prepared to document these notes with references.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-12/Usage notes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotations===
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Quotations]]''

Quotations are generally placed under the definition which they illustrate. If there is more than one being provided, or where this is not possible (e.g., a very early usage that does not clearly relate to a specific sense of the word), a separate section should be used. Quotations here are formatted normally but without definition numbers.

* '''1561''', Flat Footed (translator), Platypus (author), ''Odes'', chapter 3, line 12:
*: The '''hrunk''' it '''hrunketh''' every day.

===Synonyms===
This is a list of words that have similar meanings as the word being defined. They are often very inexact.

Where several definitions of the headword&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-08/Minor policy page changes]]&lt;/ref&gt; exist, synonyms can be given in a separate list for each meaning:

# Summarise the definition for which synonyms are being given with {{temp|sense}}.
# List the synonyms for this definition, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, [[wikify]]ing each synonym using {{temp|l}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;template l&quot;&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2016-07/Using template l to link to entries]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Use one line for each definition, beginning each line with a [[bullet]].

The synonyms section for {{m|en|apogee}} might look like this:
 * {{temp|sense|point in an orbit}} {{temp|l|en|apocenter}}, {{temp|l|en|apoapsis}}, {{temp|l|en|apsis}}
 * {{temp|sense|highest point}} {{temp|l|en|acme}}, {{temp|l|en|culmination}}, {{temp|l|en|zenith}}

To avoid identical lengthy lists of synonyms in many entries a single reference can be made in each to a common [[Wiktionary:Thesaurus|Thesaurus]] page:

 * {{temp|sense|highest point}} See also &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Thesaurus:apex]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

An alternative to listing synonyms in a separate section is their placement immediately under the corresponding definition lines with {{temp|synonyms}}:

 # The point, in an orbit about the Earth, that is furthest from the Earth.
 #: {{temp|synonyms|en|apocenter|apoapsis|apsis}}
 # The highest point.
 #: {{temp|synonyms|en|acme|culmination|zenith}}

The choice between the two formats is subject to editorial discretion.

The following headers are available to define sections containing semantically related words other than synonyms: Antonyms, Hypernyms, Hyponyms, Meronyms, Holonyms, Troponyms, Coordinate terms, See also.

Each of these sections is formatted exactly like the Synonyms section (see above).

All links in these sections use the {{temp|l}} template rather than plain wikilinks.&lt;ref name=&quot;template l&quot;/&gt;

===Derived terms===
List terms in the same language that are morphological derivatives. For example, the noun ''[[driver]]'' is derived, by addition of the suffix ''[[-er]]'', from the verb ''to [[drive]]''. If it is not known from which part of speech a certain derivative was formed it is necessary to have a “Derived terms” header on the same level as the part of speech headings.

All links in this section use the {{temp|l}} template rather than plain wikilinks.&lt;ref name=&quot;template l&quot;/&gt;

===Related terms===
List words in the same language that have strong etymological connections but aren’t derived terms. Each such term should be wikified. For example, ''[[datum]]'' and ''[[data]]'' should point to each other in this section since the latter is the plural of the former, and the plural form is not obtained by morphological derivation but was taken directly from Latin (where it is a morphological derivation). Another example is the pair of nouns ''[[pendant]]'' and ''[[pennant]]''. These should cross-reference each other as they have very similar (arguably identical) etymologies in some subsenses.

===Descendants===
List terms in other languages that have borrowed or inherited the word. The etymology of these terms should then link back to the page.

===Translations===
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Translations]]''

*'''ONLY add translations that you are CERTAIN of.''' If you aren’t familiar with a language, or aren’t sure of a particular translation, it is far better not to add it than to risk adding an incorrect translation.
*'''NEVER use automatic translation software''' to generate translations from English into a language you don’t speak. Automatic translations into English are likewise problematic. Translation software rarely gives accurate results.
*'''DO NOT COPY from translating dictionaries''' (bilingual or multilingual) as this may constitute copyright violation. This applies to dictionaries both in print form and online. Dictionaries that are [[public domain|out of copyright]] may be used.

* Translations should be given in English entries, and also in Translingual entries for taxonomic names. Entries for languages other than English and Translingual should not have Translations sections. Any translation between two foreign languages is best handled on the Wiktionaries in those languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-01/Translations of taxonomic names]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* English inflected forms will not have translations. For example, {{m|en|paints}} will not, as it is the plural and third-person singular of {{m|en|paint}}. In such entries as have additional meanings, these additional meanings should have translations. For example, the noun {{m|en|building}} should have translations, but the present participle of {{m|en|build}} will not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2011-02/Disallowing translations for English inflected forms]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The translation section is separated into a number of divisions that are keyed to the various meanings of the English word. Each division is separated into a distinct collapsible navigation box by use of the translation section templates (see below for example.) The boxes are each headed by a summary of the translated meaning.

* Within each box, the languages for which translations exist are listed in two columns by their English names in alphabetical order. The language name is preceded by a bullet (generated by &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;) followed by a colon and the translations into that language. The two columns within the collapsible navigation box are obtained by adding the {{temp|trans-top}} template just before the first language, {{temp|trans-mid}} halfway down, and {{temp|trans-bottom}} at the line after the last translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2006-12/Change style standard to use new trans-top style templates]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Use the {{temp|t}} template for each translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-12/t template in WT:ELE]]&lt;/ref&gt; This will create a link to that word in this Wiktionary and a small link to the Wiktionary for that language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2006-12/Translations with or without interwiki links]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2006-12/&quot;Translations - wiki links&quot;]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-01/Translations - wiki links (run off)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-03/Translations - wiki links clarify 3]]&lt;/ref&gt; References for the translation should be on that other page rather than in the translation list. If you think {{temp|t}} is too complex, simply enclose the translation in square brackets.

* Translations not in the Latin script should display a transliteration according to that language’s [[:Category:Transliteration policies|transliteration policy]], unless the policy states otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-01/Automated transliterations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Do not link the language name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-03/ELE text about wikifying language names]]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Correct:
**:*Portuguese: {{t|pt|cachorro|m}}
** Incorrect:
**:*[[Portuguese]]: {{t|pt|cachorro|m}}

* Provide the grammatical gender of the translations of nouns, if appropriate, giving parameters such as m, f, n and c for “masculine”, “feminine”, “neuter” and “common” respectively to {{temp|t}}.

* Do not add the pronunciation of the translation or detailed grammatical information: such information should be provided on the page for the translation itself.

* Ensure that multiple translations are given in full. For example, for the German for “ankle”, which is ''Knöchel'' or ''Fußknöchel'', write:
*:*German: {{t|de|Knöchel|m}}, {{t|de|Fußknöchel|m}}
:rather than just combining the two as “(Fuß-) Knöchel” or similar, which is liable to be misunderstood.

* Do not give literal (word-for-word) translations of idioms, unless the literal translation is what is actually used in the [[target language]]. Most idioms do not translate word for word. For example, the idiom “none of your beeswax” cannot be translated into German literally as “nicht dein Bienenwachs”, as this does not have the same meaning in German; an idiomatic translation is “nicht dein Bier” (which means, literally, “not your beer” in English).

* Do not give translations back into English of idiomatic translations. For example, when translating “bell bottoms” into French as “pattes d’éléphant”, do not follow this with the literal translation back into English of “elephant’s feet”. While this sort of information is undoubtedly interesting, it belongs in the entry for the translation itself.

Here is an example (a shortened version of the entry for ''[[orange]]'') illustrating some of the conventions:&lt;ref name=2010-08&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-08/Minor policy page changes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# The [[fruit]] of the [[orange tree]].
# The [[reddish]]-[[yellow]] [[colour]] of an orange.

====Translations====
{{trans-top|fruit of the orange tree}}
* French: {{t|fr|orange|f}}
* German: {{t|de|Apfelsine|f}}, {{t|de|Orange|f}}
* Japanese: {{t|ja|オレンジ|tr=orenji}}
{{trans-mid}}
* Russian: {{t|ru|апельси́н|m}}
* Serbo-Croatian:
*: Cyrillic: {{t|sh|наранџа|f|sc=Cyrl}}, {{t|sh|поморанџа|f|sc=Cyrl}}
*: Roman: {{t|sh|narandža|f}}, {{t|sh|pomorandža|f}}
{{trans-bottom}}

{{trans-top|colour of an orange}}
* German: {{t|de|Orange|n}}
* Hebrew: {{t|he|כתום|m|tr=katóm|alt=כתום \ כָּתֹם}}
{{trans-mid}}
* Latvian: {{t|lt|oranžs|m}}
{{trans-bottom}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* When a translation in the target language is not a lemma form, use &lt;tt&gt;alt&lt;/tt&gt; parameter to display the translation but use lemma-forms as the page name, e.g. the Russian translation of {{m|en|asleep}} links to the Russian verb {{l|ru|спать|t=to sleep}} but displays {{l|ru|спать|спя́щий|lit=sleeping}}, which is an equivalent of {{m|en|asleep}}.
&lt;pre&gt;
...
* Russian: {{t+|ru|спать|alt=спя́щий|sc=Cyrl}}
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

* When there is no single word equivalent in the target language, use {{temp|t}} with embedded wikilinks for the individual words. For example the Russian translation of {{m|en|livelihood}}:

&lt;pre&gt;
...
* Russian: {{t|ru|[[средство|сре́дства]] [[к]] [[существование|существова́нию]]|n-p}}
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Result:

* Russian: {{t|ru|[[средство|сре́дства]] [[к]] [[существование|существова́нию]]|n-p}}

===Trivia===
Other observations may be added, under the heading “Trivia”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-02/Trivia]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the unlimited range of possibilities, no formatting details can be provided.

===See also===
The “See also” section is used to link to entries and/or other pages on Wiktionary, including appendices and categories. Don’t use this section to link to external sites such as Wikipedia or other encyclopedias and dictionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;extsources&quot;/&gt;

===References===
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:References]]''

The “References” section contains reference works where users can verify the information available on our entries. This improves the reliability and usefulness of Wiktionary. References are especially encouraged for unusual or disputable claims in etymologies — such as the etymology of ''[[windhover]]'' — or usage notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;extsources&quot;/&gt;

* References may be given in a normal bibliographic format showing author, title, place of publication, publisher and year of publication.
* [[:Category:Reference templates|Reference templates]] are used for some of the most common sources.

===Further reading===
The “Further reading” section contains simple recommendations of further places to look.&lt;ref name=&quot;extsources&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;furtherreading&quot;/&gt;

* This section may be used to link to external dictionaries and encyclopedias, (for example, Wikipedia, or 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica) which may be available online or in print.
* This section is ''not'' meant to prove the validity of what is being stated on the Wiktionary entries (the “References” section serves that purpose).

Examples:
* {{R:Century 1911|water}}
* {{R:Webster 1913|water}}

===Anagrams===
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Anagrams]]''

Anagrams may be entered in alphabetical order under a level 3 header &lt;nowiki&gt;===Anagrams===&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Only list anagrams that are words in the same language. You may include the [[alphagram]] which is not wikied unless it is itself a word. For [[post]], the anagrams section would look like this:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;s&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2009-12/Modify anagram section of ELE]]&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2011-11/Update ELE anagram format]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
* [[opts]], [[pots]], [[spot]], [[stop]], [[tops]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Metadata==
This is material which is edited in a regular edit box, but does not appear in the entry when it is read. In some cases where it appears depends on your user preferences, especially the skin that you have chosen.

===Category links===
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Categorization]]''

A Wiktionary category is a group of related entries which are listed on a category page. Sub-categories may also appear on that page. Categories and lists under various names may seem very similar, but the way they are built is very different; in most cases, but especially in open-ended lists, they complement each other.

To include an entry in a category, simply add a category tag to the entry thus:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[Category:Category name]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The link will appear at the bottom of the page in some skins and at the top in others, regardless of where it is placed in the edit box. Category links are placed one per line at the end of the appropriate language section.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-05/Categories at end of language section]]&lt;/ref&gt; Putting these tags in a consistent place makes them easier to find in a longer entry’s edit field. A category link appears red if its category page has not yet been described, but categorized entries will appear there. You should edit a new category page, usually to add a brief description of the category and adding one or more tags to place it in a higher-level category.

By convention, it is preferable to use the plural for most category names that are nouns. This will avoid having a category divided in two when some use the plural and some use the singular.

==Images==
Lemma entries, whether English or non-English, can contain relevant images. Constraints:
* An image of a person relating to the coinage or etymology should be excluded unless another rationale for inclusion applies. Thus, [[newspeak]] should not contain an image of George Orwell, and [[Pythagorean theorem]] should not contain an image of Pythagoras.
Further constraints may apply on a case-by-case basis, as decided by editors.

      <comment>/* Adjective */ Remove 'nonbrown' antonym. Yes, it exists and is (debatably) a valid antonym, but I don't think those are sufficient criteria for including it - it needs to also be plausibly useful to an average reader, which I think this is not.

From {{inh|en|enm|broun}}, from {{inh|en|ang|brūn||brown; dark; dusky}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*brūnaz}} (compare {{cog|fy|brún}}, {{cog|nl|bruin}}, {{cog|de|braun}}), from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*bʰerH-}} (compare {{cog|grc|φρύνη}}, {{m|grc|φρῦνος||toad}}; Latin {{m|la|brunneus||brown}}), compare {{cog|lt|bė́ras||brown}}, {{cog|sa|बभ्रु||tr=babhrú|reddish-brown}}). {{doublet|en|bruin}}.

The word was inspired by a line in the ''Eton Latin Grammar'' (published in the early 19th century), in which some nouns commonly used in the [[genitive]] case with some verbs like {{m|la|pendo}} and {{m|la|facio}} are listed, which express evaluating something as worthless or as previously mentioned:

{{shortcut|WT:DELETE}}

The following are guidelines on what to delete and what not to. It covers both speedy deletion and deletion by consensus.

== What to delete and what to keep ==

* The general rule is that anything that apparently doesn’t meet [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion]] is a candidate for deletion.
* Any of the following may be the basis for a speedy (i.e. immediate) deletion request:
*# '''Complete rubbish:'''  The contents don’t make sense or are clearly someone’s idea of a joke.  If the material is clearly obscene or libellous, you should also edit the page to a blank state.  Before you request to delete, try to make sure that the article doesn’t fall under “Never heard the word” or “Good title, garbage content” below.
*# '''Title misspelled:'''  Move the article to the correct title.  If there is already an article at the correct title merge any useful material on there.  Occasionally, a misspelling may be so common that it needs to be noted, or it may be an accepted variant spelling of the word.  In that case the article should be retained, but reduced to a simple explanation of the situation.  In the case of alternate spellings, the substantive article may be under either spelling.  Preference should be given to the more common spelling, but where this cannot be determined give preference to the spelling under which the article was first created.
*# '''Protologisms''' (i.e. words that have been made up by the poster) used to have their place in [[Appendix:List of protologisms]], but that page is no longer being maintained. Usually, it is decided during the [[WT:RFD|RFD]] process whether a word deserves listing, but you can also be bold and add it yourself. The remaining entry can then be tagged by {{temp|delete}} to be deleted.
*# '''Self-promotion:''' Pages which appear to promote some specific person or entity are discouraged, but should not be removed without time for discussion on [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]].  Widely-used trademarks are generally OK, since including them in Wiktionary is not likely to have any significant impact. The main concern is that Wiktionary not be used as a vehicle to promote a person or entity.
*# '''Licence violations:''' Pages whose content has been copied from another source, where that source is protected by a current copyright or otherwise incompatible with our Terms of Use.
*# '''Good title, garbage content:''' Someone either didn’t know what they were doing, or was having their idea of fun.
*## Check the history.  If a legitimate entry has been overwritten, click on the link for that version, click on “Edit”, and save with the comment “rv vandalism”.
*## If not, but you can provide a good definition, do so.
*## If you don’t have anything meaningful to put there it is better to delete the page; this will leave all links to the page in red telling everyone that the page still needs to be done. 

The most common reasons for deletion by consensus are “this entry is not idiomatic” (from {{section link|Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Idiomaticity}} and “this entry does not exist” (from {{section link|Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Attestation}}).

When in doubt, it is usually better to give the benefit of the doubt to keeping the entry. This has a positive effect on the overall communal mental health.
 
* Things to keep
*# Stubs: These are not the problem that they are in Wikipedia. Some short short articles are satisfactorily complete when they only describe that a particular word as a variant spelling of another, or that it is an inflected form. Other substandard short entries may be improved rapidly. If there is apparently correct and relevant content, use [[Wiktionary:Requests for cleanup]].
*# Frequently occurring misspellings and ungrammatical forms: This is not a mandate to keep all manner of misspelled words and typos; there should be an instructive quality to the retention. These should explain the error and link to the correct form. Forms with diacritics missing should also be kept, explained and linked to the correct spelling.  For example, [[seperate]] contains the text {{misspelling of|en|separate|nocat=1|nodot=1}}.

== How to do it ==

* If, having read the above, you feel sure an entry should be deleted:
*# Put {{temp|d}} at the top of the entry if you believe it qualifies for immediate deletion. An administrator will either delete it, untag it or retag it with {{temp|rfd}} (see below).
*# Put {{temp|rfd}} at the top of the language section.
*# Add a link to the unwanted page in [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]]. The quickest way is to click on the cross &lt;sup&gt;(+)&lt;/sup&gt;.
*# Include a brief explanation as to why you think the page should be deleted.
*# Sign your suggestion for deletion (use four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;, to sign with your user name and the current date).  This will allow people to contact you in case of questions about your proposal.
*# Continue to comment on the debate as it progresses if you wish to.
*# Please note that the same process applies to ''individual definitions''. Therefore, individual definitions should only be speedily deleted if they are clearly nonsense or vandalism. Or, unlike whole pages, where two definitions are clearly the same they may be merged without going through [[WT:RFD]]. This should be clearly marked in the [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]] to avoid accusations of trying to [[clandestinely]] delete the definition.

== Notes to administrators ==

Administrators have no special status in determining which pages to delete.  Their job is to implement the consensus of the community.  If there is any uncertainty about whether there is such a consensus, it is safer not to delete the page, but instead flag it RFD or RFV.

Some entries are clearly rubbish and should be speedily deleted. However, for everything but the most blatant entries, a quick check on Google Books should be made. And since not all durably archived materials are on Google Books, other searches like Google Scholar, Google Groups and Google itself.

# If there’s debate on [[WT:RFD]] or [[WT:RFV]] (or more rarely on other forums) clearly indicate why the entry has been deleted, and by whom.
# Click on ''What links here'', and fix any links that are going to be broken. Remember not all red links are undesirable.
# Delete the talk page and any subpages first, since these are not automatically deleted along with the page.
# Delete the page.
# If the page is listed on [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]] or [[Wiktionary:Requests for verification]], add a comment saying that it was deleted.

=== To delete a page ===

# On the page itself, click the arrow between history and the search bar located above the page content. Choose delete, give a reason in the deletion box and confirm the delete. Good deletion summaries can prevent conflict later on.

== Undeletion ==

If a page gets deleted, it remains in a state from which it can be [[undeleted]]. Anyone with deletion authority also has undeletion authority. If you consider that a page has been deleted unfairly you could either:

# Create it again. This may annoy people and possibly lead to a block ([[Wiktionary:Blocking policy]]).
# Ask an administrator to undelete it, giving a valid reason.  The optimal situation is to address this to the administrator who deleted it in the first place, as they might have had cause to delete it that another admin would not be aware of.
# List the page on [[WT:RFD]] and clearly mark it as an undeletion request. Particularly useful for entries that have been deleted by consensus, as consensus can change over time.

{{wikipedia|February}}

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|en|Feb.}}, {{l|en|Feb}}
* {{sense|Roman month}} {{l|en|Februarius}}

===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|Februarie}}, {{m|enm|februari}}, {{m|enm|februare}}, from {{der|en|la|Februārius||the [[month]] of the [[Februa]]}}, from {{m|la|Fēbrua||the [[purging|Purging]]s, the [[purification|Purification]]s}}, a Roman holiday two days after its [[ides]] (i.e., Feb. 15), + {{m|la|-arius||[[-ary]]: ''[[form]]ing [[adjective]]s''}}. {{m|la|Fēbrua}} from {{m|la|fēbruum||[[purging]]}}, from an earlier {{der|en|sbv}} word, possibly from {{der|en|ine-pro|*dʰewh₂-||[[smoke]], [[haze]]}} and thus cognate with {{m|en|thio-||[[sulfurous]]}} and {{der|en|grc|θεῖον||[[sulfur]]}} or from {{der|en|ine-pro|*dʰegʷʰris}}, an extension of the root {{m|ine-pro|*dʰegʷʰ-|gloss=to [[burn]]}} and thus cognate with {{m|en|fever}} and {{m|la|febris}}. A relatinization abandoning {{der|en|enm|feoverel}}, from {{der|en|fro|feverier}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{a|UK}} {{IPA|en|/ˈfɛb.ɹʊ.ə.ɹi/|/ˈfɛb.j(ʊ.)ə.ɹi/|/ˈfɛb.ɹə.ɹi/|/ˈfɛb.ɹi/}}
* {{a|US}} {{IPA|en|/ˈfɛb.ɹuˌɛɹi/|/ˈfɛb.juˌɛ(ə)ɹi/}}; {{enPR|fĕbʹro͞o-ĕr'-ē|fĕbʹyo͞o-ĕr'-ē}}
* {{audio|en|en-us-February.ogg|Audio (GA)}}
* {{audio|en|en-uk-february.ogg|Audio (RP)}}
* {{hyphenation|en|Feb|ru|ary}}&lt;ref&gt;{{R:Hyphenation exception log}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pronunciation of the first ''r'' as {{IPAchar|/j/}} has come about by [[dissimilation]] and [[analogy]] with {{m|en|January}}. In the UK pronunciation {{IPAchar|/ˈfɛb.ɹi/}} ({{m|en||*Febry}}) the sequence {{IPAchar|/ɹə.ɹi/}} in {{IPAchar|/ˈfɛb.ɹə.ɹi/}} ({{m|en||*Febrery}}) is simplified to {{IPAchar|/ɹi/}} by [[haplology]].

===Proper noun===
{{en-proper noun|Februaries|Februarys}}

# The [[short]] [[month]] following [[January]] and preceding [[March]] in the [[Roman]], [[Julian]], and [[Gregorian calendar]]s, [[use]]d in [[all]] [[three]] [[calendar]]s for [[intercalation]] or [[addition]] of [[leap day]]s.
#* '''2011''', Robert A. Kaster trans. [[w:Macrobius|Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'', Book I, Chapter xiii, Sections 3–5:
#*: ...The second he [''[[sc.]]'' [[w:Numa Pompilius|King Numa]]] dedicated to the god [[Februus]], who is believed to control rites of purification: the community had to be purified in that month, when he determined that the Good Gods be paid the offerings due them... Numa soon added one day to January, paying honor to the mystery of the odd number that nature revealed even before [[w:Pythagoras|Pythagoras]]: as a result, both the year as a whole and the individual months (save '''February''') had an odd number of days. (If all twelve months had either an odd or even number of days, their total would be an even number...)
#* '''2011''', Robert A. Kaster trans. [[w:Macrobius|Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'', Book I, Chapter xiii, Sections 14–15:
#*: '''February''' was set aside for the intercalation because it was the last month of the year... They departed from the Greeks in one respect, however: whereas the latter intercalated when the final month was over, the Romans intercalated after the twenty-third day of '''February''', at the conclusion of the [[Terminalia]]. They then added on the last five days of '''February''' after the intercalary period, acting on the religious scruple of ancient custom, I think, so that March would follow on '''February''' no matter what.
#* '''2011''', Robert A. Kaster trans. [[w:Macrobius|Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'', Book I, Chapter xiv, Sections 6–7:
#*: [[w:Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar]], then, added ten days to the old practice, so that the 365 days in which the sun circles the zodiac would make a year; and to account for the one-quarter day, he ordained that the priests who attended to the months and days would insert one day every fourth year, in the same month and place where the ancients used to intercalate a month, that is, before the last five days of '''February''', and he decreed that it be called the 'twice sixth'... he added no days to '''February''', so that the religious observances offered to the gods of the dead would not be changed...
#: ''Susan was born on '''February''' 29.''
# {{lb|en|rare}} {{given name|en|female|from=English}}.
#* {{quote-book|en|year=2011|author=Kristen Ashley|title=For You|passage=“Cheryl, the man in this photo is a Mr. Dennis Lowe. He worked for a computer software company and he was married. He was impersonating a police officer, a real one by the name of Alexander Colton. He was doing this because he's obsessed with a woman named '''February'''—” Nowakowski stopped talking because Cheryl Sheckle's body jerked violently and she let out a muted cry. {{...|“Fuck, he called her '''February''',” Sully muttered. “No,” Cheryl whispered. [...] “He said it was a nickname.” Warren shook his head then,}} “It isn't a nickname, Cheryl. It's a real person, her name is '''February''' Owens and he's been obsessed with her since they went to high school together.”}}

=====Usage notes=====
* {{m|en||May}} is now a [[defective verb]]. It has no infinitive, no past participle, and no future tense. Forms of {{m|en|to be allowed to}} are used to replace these missing tenses.
* The simple past (both indicative and subjunctive) of {{m|en|may}} is {{m|en|might}}
* The present tense is negated as {{m|en|[[may]] [[not]]}}, which can be contracted to {{m|en|mayn't}}, although this is old-fashioned; the simple past is negated as {{m|en|[[might]] [[not]]}}, which can be contracted to {{m|en|mightn't}}.
* {{m|en|may|May}} has archaic second-person singular present forms {{m|en|mayest}} and {{m|en|mayst}}.
* Usage of this word in the sense of {{m|en|possibly}} is considered incorrect by some speakers and writers, as it blurs the meaning of the word in the sense ''have permission to''. These speakers and writers prefer to use the word {{m|en|might}} instead.
* Conversely, since '''may not''' is particularly likely to promote confusion between the senses of &quot;will possibly not&quot; and &quot;is forbidden to,&quot; some rules for the drafting of laws and regulations proscribe &quot;may not&quot; and require the use of &quot;must not&quot; or similar for clarity. Example: [https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/legis-redact/legistics/p1p8.html]
* Wishes are often cast in the imperative rather than the subjunctive mood, not using the word {{m|en||may}}, as in ''Have a great day!'' rather than ''May you have a great day''. The use of '''may''' for this purpose may lend a more formal, literary, or solemn feeling (perhaps jocularly so) to the wish. Moreover, wishes in the subjunctive need not use ''may'' if the meaning is clear without it, as in {{m|en||God help you}}.

===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|June}}, {{m|enm|june}}, re-Latinised variants of earlier {{der|en|enm|Juyn}}, {{m|enm|juyng}}, from {{der|en|fro|juing}}, {{m|fro|juin}}, from {{der|en|la|iūnius}}, the month of the goddess {{m|la|Iuno||Juno}}, perhaps from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h₂yéwHō}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*h₂óyu||vital force, youthful vigor}}.

===Pronunciation===

===Proper noun===
{{en-proper noun|Junes}}

# The sixth [[month]] of the [[Gregorian calendar]], following [[May]] and preceding [[July]]. Abbreviation: '''[[Jun]]''' or '''[[Jun.]]'''
#* {{quote-book|en|year=1913|author={{w|Joseph C. Lincoln}}
|title=[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL5535161W Mr. Pratt's Patients]|chapter=1
|passage='Twas early '''June''', the new grass was flourishing everywheres, the posies in the yard—peonies and such—in full bloom, the sun was shining, and the water of the bay was blue, with light green streaks where the shoal showed.}}
# {{given name|en|female|from=English}} for a girl born in June, used since the end of the 19th century.
#* {{quote-book|en|year=2002|author={{w|Kate Atkinson}}|title=Not the End of the World|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0385604726|page=29|passage=Her parents were old, really old. That's why they'd given her such an old-fashioned name. '''June''', because she was born in June. If she'd been born in November would they have called her November? '''June''' was a name for women in sitcoms and soap operas, the name of women who knit with synthetic wool and follow recipes that use cornflakes, not the name of a thirty-year-old with a ring in her nose ('Oh, '''June''''.)}}

      <text bytes="9758" xml:space="preserve">To start editing, click the {{VectorTab|Edit}} tab at the top right of a Wiktionary entry (but, obviously, not until you’ve finished reading this).

The [[w:MediaWiki|software]] that powers Wiktionary is designed to make editing as easy as possible, but there are going to be a few strange things. That’s because you can create ''far more than just plain text''.

==Formatting==
The '''single quote''' (or apostrophe) character ' has the following special uses for formatting text:
*''Italic text'' is generated by typing two single quotes before and after the characters you want italicised, like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''Italic text''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
*'''Bold text''' is generated by typing three single quotes before and after the characters you want bolded: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''Bold text'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
* You can of course combine the two to get '''''bold italic text''''' by using five single quotes: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''''bold italic text'''''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
*: Or, as is used in our example sentences, you can have an ''italic sentence with '''bold italic words''' in it'':
*::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;... an ''italic sentence with '''bold italic words''' in it''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
*A single quote by itself has no special effect, so you can make words containing apostrophes ''italicised'' or '''bold''' too:
*:Typing &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;my ''dog's'' ball&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives you my ''dog's'' ball.
*:Typing &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;my '''dog's''' ball&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives you my '''dog's''' ball.
*:For possessives ending with an apostrophe: 
*::For the ''Jones''' house, type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;the ''Jones''' house&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
*::For the '''Jones'''' house, type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;the '''Jones'''' house&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
*::For the '''''Jones'''''' house, type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;the '''''Jones'''''' house&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
*The double quote &quot; character has no special effect and can be used &quot;normally&quot; around or within italics and/or bold text:
*:He said, &quot;now ''you'' too '''''can''''' type '''some &quot;bold&quot; words''' or ''some &quot;italic&quot; words''.&quot;
*::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;He said, &quot;now ''you'' too '''''can''''' type '''some &quot;bold&quot; words''' or ''some &quot;italic&quot; words''.&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*We '''don’t use underlining''' because it makes text look like links.

==Basic lines==
Looking at a dictionary entry, you can see that a lot of lines are different. For example definitions are numbered, translations have a bullet point, example sentences are indented&amp;nbsp;...
* Numbered lines are made by &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# Starting the line with a # sign&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*# Starting the line with a # sign
*# They should be used only for definitions
* Bullet pointed lines are created for lines &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;* Starting with a * sign&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** Starting with a * sign
** They are used for any kind of list, in particular in translations.
* Indented lines are those &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;: Starting with a : sign&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*: Starting with a : sign
*: These are used for example sentences in conjunction with # in the definitions section, and in discussions
* It is possible to combine these, to create lists within lists&amp;nbsp;– as I have done here, by putting two characters together.
*# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;An example definition
*#: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''With an '''example''' sentence''.

==Links==
Linking is one of the main benefits of a wiki like this. Links enable one-click navigation among related pages.

Although we haven’t used many on this page, you will often see [[blue]] text around, or occasionally [[Talk:--error: Link target missing--|red]] text. These are both links: the blue indicates that an entry exists (though not necessarily in the right language), the red that the entry does not exist yet and ''may'' need creating.

Words in ''lists'' always get linked, otherwise there is little point in having the list. Deciding when to use links in prose requires a bit of judgment; more detailed guidance may be found at [[Wiktionary:Links]].
# The use of an [[unusual]] word in a definition should be linked.
# As should any technical terms that the [[context]] requires.

Here are some basics of '''how''' to make links. Although basic links are simple, linking effectively can be much neater, so a quick whiz through how to link:
*A general link is created by typing double square brackets around the term, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[thusly]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is rendered [[thusly]].
*:Links in Wiktionary are '''case sensitive''' so &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Thusly]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t work: [[Thusly]].
*Links should point to the main form of a word, and not its plurals or past tenses. In many cases this is easy:
*:To get [[want]]ed to link to “want” you type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[want]]ed&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*In cases where a term won’t fit nicely like that, you have to tell it exactly what “target” page you want by using the “pipe” symbol | between the target and the term, like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[target page|text to link from]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*:For example, if the text word you want to link from is the plural “fora”, the target entry is the singular “forum”, so you type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[forum|fora]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and it displays [[forum|fora]], but clicking it will take you to “forum”.
*:For idioms like “{{l|en|help oneself|help yourself}}” Wiktionary uses the neutral pronoun “one” so &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[help oneself|help yourself]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
*A link can be made to a '''section''' of a page using the hash symbol #. This can be effective to link to specific sections in large pages:
*:To link to the “Writing definitions” section in “Help:FAQ”, type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:FAQ#Writing definitions]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, giving [[Help:FAQ#Writing definitions]].
*:To link to a particular etymology’s part of speech (POS) section of an entry, like the 2nd etymology noun for the word “gloss”, put a number after the POS, like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[gloss#Noun 2]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which gives you [[gloss#Noun 2]]. (Be aware though that even if the entry for the “target” term is well-settled, the number and/or order of etymologies, POS and definitions may change, and your link may end up pointing to a different one! See {{section link|Help talk:How to edit a page#Linking to a particular definition}}.)
*Always '''''check before saving the page''''' that links you create or edit take you where you intend them to. After clicking the “Show preview” button, use the link to open a new browser tab or new window (so you don’t lose your editing session!) and check the resulting page is what you (and other users) would want.

==Headings==
As you will see, on every entry there are numerous headings of different sizes, these are generated by typing &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;==Heading==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The more equals signs are included, the smaller the heading will be. Wiktionary has very strict [[WT:ELE|Guidelines]] about the use of headings, which I would advise you to read through, when you have the time. But, as an introduction
 ==English==
 ===Noun===
 ====Synonyms====
which yields:
{{fake==|English}}
{{fake===|Noun}}
{{fake====|Synonyms}}

==Special characters==
You might also want to add characters you can’t type because they aren’t on your keyboard. You will almost certainly find any character you need in the box below the “Save page” button in editing mode. Just select the set of characters you need and have your pick. For a complete list of unicode characters look here: http://www.unicode.org/charts/

==Templates==
One often encounters cryptic abbreviations enclosed by double curly brackets in the code. These are templates and automatically substitute text into the code. So if you need the same piece of code on many pages, creating a template might be a good idea. The string &lt;nowiki&gt;{{xyz}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; will cause the page to be displayed as if the content of the page &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:xyz]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; had been in its place. An example is [[Template:rfc]] which indicates that a page has been marked for clean-up on [[Wiktionary:Requests for cleanup]]. See [[Wiktionary:Index to templates]].

==Signing==
If you are involved in a discussion, be it on a [[Wiktionary:Talk page|talk page]] or on a page such as [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]], it is considered [[Wiktionary:Welcome, newcomers#Norms and etiquette|good manners]] to sign your (user) name at the end of your post. Signing is most easily done by typing four tildes (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), which will automatically be converted into your user name (linked to your user page) and a UTC time stamp.

But of course you never sign the actual dictionary entries as they are considered the collaborative work of many editors like you.

===Customization===

*[[Wiktionary:Per-browser preferences]]&amp;nbsp;– some preferences relevant for editing
*[[User talk:Conrad.Irwin/edittools.js]]&amp;nbsp;– to customize the “edittools” (text you can insert)

From {{inh|en|enm|Thursday}}, {{m|enm|Thuresday}}, from {{inh|en|ang|þursdæġ}}, {{m|ang|þurresdæġ||Thursday}}, possibly from a contraction of {{m|ang|þunresdæġ||Thursday|lit=[[Thor]]'s day}}, but more likely of {{der|en|gmq|-}} origin, from {{der|en|non|þórsdagr|þōrsdagr}} or Old {{der|en|da|þursdag|þūrsdag|Thursday}}; all from {{der|en|gmw-pro|*Þunras dag||day of the thunder god}}. Compare {{cog|fy|tongersdei}}, {{cog|nds-de|Dunnersdag}}, {{cog|nl|donderdag}}, {{cog|de|Donnerstag}}, {{cog|da|torsdag}}. More at {{l|en|thunder}}, {{l|en|day}}.

A calque of Latin ''{{l|la|diēs Iovis}} ({{l|la|diēs Jovis}})'', via an association ({{m|la|interpretātiō germānica}}) of the god [[Thor]] with the Roman god of thunder [[Jove]] (Jupiter).

===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*dʰegʷʰ-|*preyH-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|Friday}}, from {{inh|en|ang|frīġedæġ}}. Compound of {{m|ang|frīġe}} and {{m|ang|dæġ|t=day}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*Frījā dag}}, a calque of {{der|en|la|diēs Veneris}}, via an association ({{m|la|interpretātiō germānica}}) of the goddess [[Frigg]] with the Roman goddess of love [[Venus]].

Compare {{cog|fy|freed}}, {{cog|nds-de|Freedag}}, {{m|nds-de|Friedag}}, {{cog|nl|vrijdag}}, {{cog|de|Freitag}}, {{cog|da|fredag}}.
{{cog|non|Frigg}} (genitive {{m|no|Friggjar}}), {{cog|osx|Fri}}, and {{cog|ang|Frig}} are derived from {{cog|gem-pro|*Frijjō}}. Frigg is cognate with {{cog|sa|प्रिया|tr=priyā́|t=wife}}. The root also appears in {{cog|osx|fri|t=beloved lady}}; in {{cog|sv|fria}}, in {{cog|da|-}} and {{cog|no|-}} as {{m|da|fri|t=to propose for marriage}}; a related meaning exists in Icelandic as {{m|is|frjá|t=to love}} and similarly in {{cog|nl|vrijen|t=to make love (to have sex)}}.

===Pronunciation===

* {{audio|en|en-us-Friday.ogg|Audio (GA)}}
* {{audio|en|En-uk-Friday.ogg|Audio (RP)}}
* {{rhymes|en|aɪdeɪ|aɪdi}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# The '''sixth day''' of the [[week]] in many religious traditions, and the '''fifth day''' of the week in systems using the [[w:ISO 8601|ISO 8601]] norm; the [[Muslim]] [[Sabbath]]; it follows [[Thursday]] and precedes [[Saturday]].
&lt;!--probably just an attributive form of the noun: #An appointment, person (like Man Friday in ''Robinson Crusoe''), or feeling associated with this day of the week.--&gt;

      <comment>There's no full stop on the caption given in the example, so the image showing the rendered example shouldn't either. I realize you guys don't have a formal policy on sentence-fragment punctuation yet [[w:MOS:CAPTION|as Wikipedia does]].</comment>

[[File:Glass-Ball.jpg|thumb|Example image caption]]

It is recommended that all pictures be uploaded to [[commons:|Commons]].

==Image preferences==
[[special:userlogin|Logged in users]] can set the size of thumbnails they want in [[special:preferences]] under &quot;files&quot;.  The default, used by those not logged in, is 180 [[pixel]]s.  Logged in users can choose from widths of 120px, 150px, 180px, 200px, 250px or 300px. &lt;!-- See [[Wikipedia:Thumbnail size]] for examples. (might write this later) --&gt;

Also under files in [[Special:Preferences]] you can set the size limit of images shown on  [[w:image description page|image description page]]s. By default, if either the width or the height exceeds 800px or 600px respectively, then the image is reduced in size until it fits within those dimensions.  You can choose from sizes of 320x240px, 640x480px, 800x600px, 1024x768px, 1280x1024px, or 10000x10000px.  The last will effectively display all images at 100% resolution.

==Using images==
To incorporate your image in an article you need to use the [[w:Wikipedia:Extended image syntax|image markup]].  As an example in its simplest form, to reproduce the photograph at the top of this page you need to insert the following text into an article:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Glass-Ball.jpg|thumb|Example image caption]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Where the image is called [[:File:Glass-Ball.jpg|Glass-Ball.jpg]]. &quot;thumb&quot; forces the creation of a thumbnail and you should replace &quot;Example image caption&quot; with a caption.

It gets a bit more complex than this&amp;mdash;see [[w:Wikipedia:Image markup]]&amp;mdash;but the vast majority of images should be displayed in the above format.

Please note that the forced-resizing is discouraged on Wiktionary, as it overrides user preferences.  Thumbnails are by default on the right; please do not reposition them on the left or centered.  No formal policy exists to specify if they belong at the top of the entry, or closest to where they are defined.  For pictures describing English words, they seem to work best when opposite the table of contents (by putting the image wikitext before the first heading.)

==Placement==
An image should usually be placed alongside the definition that it illustrates. If there are too many images in a particular section for this placement to be possible an image gallery may be created that is left-aligned (see [[A]] for an example). Galleries are commonly placed at the foot of the Part-of-speech section or in a '''See also''' section.

As an international dictionary, Wiktionary is intended to include “all words in all languages”, subject to the following criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2017-06/CFI leading sentence]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{shortcut|WT:CFI}}

==General rule==
A term should be included if it's likely that someone would {{m|en|run across}} it and want to know what it means. This in turn leads to the somewhat more formal guideline of including a [[#Terms|term]] if it is '''[[#Attestation|attested]]''' and, when that is met, if it is a single word or it is '''[[#Idiomaticity|idiomatic]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-10/CFI and idiomaticity clarification]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms===
A term need not be limited to a single word in the usual sense. Any of these are also acceptable:
* Compounds and multiple-word terms such as {{m|en|post office}}.
* [[idiom|Idiom]]s such as {{m|en|go on}} and {{m|en|give up the ghost}}.
* [[proverb|Proverb]]s.
* [[abbreviation|Abbreviation]]s, [[acronym]]s, and [[initialism]]s such as {{m|en|NBA}}.
* [[prefix|Prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es such as {{m|en|re-}} and {{m|en|-ist}}.
* Characters used in [[ideograph]]ic or [[phonetic]] writing such as {{m|mul|字}} or {{m|mul|ʃ}}.

===Attestation===
{{shortcut|WT:ATTEST}}
“[[attested#Adjective|Attested]]” means verified through&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-11/Attestation in academic journals]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#clearly widespread use, or
#use in permanently recorded media, [[#Conveying meaning|conveying meaning]], in at least three [[#Independent|independent]] instances spanning at least a year ([[#Number of citations|different requirements]] apply for certain languages).&lt;ref name=&quot;2012-04&quot;&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-04/Languages with limited documentation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where possible, it is better to cite sources that are likely to remain easily accessible over time, so that someone referring to Wiktionary years from now is likely to be able to find the original source. As Wiktionary is an online dictionary, this naturally favors media such as Usenet groups, which are durably archived by Google. Print media such as books and magazines will also do, particularly if their contents are indexed online. Other recorded media such as audio and video are also acceptable, provided they are of verifiable origin and are durably archived. We do not quote other Wikimedia sites&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-04/WMF jargon]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-06/WMF jargon accepted when it meets CFI]]&lt;/ref&gt; (such as Wikipedia), but we may use quotations found on them (such as quotations from books available on Wikisource). When citing a quotation from a book, please include the ISBN.

====Conveying meaning====
{{also|Wikipedia:use–mention distinction}}
This filters out appearance in raw word lists, commentary on the form of a word, such as “The word ‘foo’ has three letters,” lone definitions, and made-up examples of how a word might be used. For example, an appearance in someone’s online dictionary is suggestive, but it does not show the word actually used to convey meaning. On the other hand, a sentence like “They raised the jib (a small sail forward of the mainsail) in order to get the most out of the light wind,” appearing in an account of a sailboat race, would be fine. It happens to contain a definition, but the word is also used for its meaning.

====Number of citations====
For [[WT:Criteria for inclusion/Well documented languages|languages well documented on the Internet]], three citations in which a term is used is the minimum number for inclusion in Wiktionary. For terms in extinct languages, one use in a contemporaneous source is the minimum, or one mention is adequate subject to the below requirements. For all other spoken languages that are living, only one use or mention is adequate, subject to the following requirements:

* the community of editors for that language should maintain a list of materials deemed appropriate as the only sources for entries based on a single mention,
* each entry should have its source(s) listed on the entry or citation page, and
* a box explaining that a low number of citations were used should be included on the entry page (such as by using the {{temp|LDL}} template).&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-06/Well Documented Languages]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Independent====
This serves to prevent double-counting of usages that are not truly distinct. Roughly speaking, we generally consider two uses of a term to be &quot;independent&quot; if they are in different sentences by different people, and to be non-independent if:

* one is a verbatim or near-verbatim quotation of the other; or
* both are verbatim or near-verbatim quotations or translations of a single original source; or
* both are by the same author.

If two or more usages are not independent of each other, then only one of them can be used for purposes of attestation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-02/Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spanning at least a year====
This is meant to filter out words that may appear and see brief use, but then never be used again. The one-year threshold is somewhat arbitrary, but appears to work well in practice.

=== Idiomaticity ===
{{shortcut|WT:SOP}}
An expression is '''idiomatic''' if its full meaning cannot be easily derived from the meaning of its separate components. Non-idiomatic expressions are called '''sum-of-parts''' (SOP).

For example, ''this is a door'' is not idiomatic, but {{m|en|shut up}} and {{m|en|red herring}} are.

This criterion is sometimes referred to as the ''fried egg test'', as a [[fried egg]] generally means an egg (and generally a chicken egg or similar) fried in a particular way.  It generally doesn't denote a [[scrambled egg]], which may nonetheless be cooked by frying.

See [[Wiktionary:Idioms that survived RFD]] for other examples. However, many idioms are clearly idiomatic, for example {{m|en|red herring}}.  These tests are invoked only in discussion of unclear cases.

Phrasebook entries are very common expressions that are considered useful to non-native speakers. Although these are included as entries in the dictionary (in the main namespace), they are not usually considered in these terms. For instance, {{m|en|what is your name}} is clearly a summation of its parts.

Unidiomatic terms made up of multiple words are included if they are significantly more common than single-word spellings that meet criteria for inclusion; for example, {{m|en|coalmine}} meets criteria for inclusion, so its more common form {{m|en|coal mine}} is also included.&lt;ref&gt;([[WT:COALMINE]]) [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2009-12/Unidiomatic multi-word phrases to meet CFI when the more common spelling of a single word]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2019-08/Rescinding the &quot;Coalmine&quot; policy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An attested integer word (such as {{m|en|twenty-three}} or {{m|en|twenty-third}}) or a decimal numeral (sequence of 0, ..., 9 digits) that is ≥ 0 and ≤ 100 should be kept even if it is not idiomatic. In sequences of digits such as 125, the digits are considered to be separate components for the purpose of idiomaticity, and therefore, the sequences are often not idiomatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;numerals&quot;&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2017-05/Numbers, numerals, and ordinals]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare cases, a phrase that is arguably unidiomatic may be included by the consensus of the community, based on the determination of editors that inclusion of the term is likely to be useful to readers.

Idiomaticity rules apply to hyphenated compounds in the same way as to spaced phrases. For example, ''wine-lover'', ''green-haired'', ''harsh-sounding'' and ''ex-teacher'' are all excluded as they mean no more than the sum of their parts, while ''[[green-fingered]]'' and ''[[good-looking]]'' are included as idiomatic.

=== Translation hubs ===
{{shortcut|WT:THUB}}
A translation hub (translation target) is a common English multi-word term or collocation that is useful for hosting translations. Some attested translation hubs should be included despite being non-idiomatic and some excluded, but there is no agreement on precise, all-encompassing rules for deciding which are which. Therefore, the following criteria for inclusion of attested non-idiomatic translation hubs are tentative:&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2018-03/Including translation hubs]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The attested English term has to be common; rare terms don't qualify.
* A translation does not qualify to support the English term if it is:
** a closed compound that is a word-for-word translation of the English term: German {{m|de|Autoschlüssel}} does not qualify to support the English &quot;car key&quot;; or
** a multi-word phrase that is a word-for-word translation of the English term; or
** a diminutive: Spanish {{m|es|mecedorcito}} does not qualify to support the English &quot;small rocking chair&quot;; or
** an augmentative: Portuguese {{m|pt|amigão}} does not qualify to support the English &quot;good friend&quot;; or
** a comparative or a superlative; or
** a phrase in a language that does not use spaces to separate words.
* At the very least, two qualifying translations must support the English term. Editor judgment can require a higher number, on a case-by-case basis.
* The existence of a rare single-word English synonym of the considered English term does not disqualify the considered English term: the existence of {{m|en|Anglistics}}, which is rare, does not disqualify {{m|en|English studies}}.

===Numbers, numerals, and ordinals===
Numbers, numerals, and ordinals over 100 that are not single words or are sequences of digits should not be included in the dictionary, unless the number, numeral, or ordinal in question has a separate idiomatic sense that meets the CFI.&lt;ref name=&quot;numerals&quot;/&gt;

===Spellings===
&lt;span id=&quot;Misspellings, common misspellings and variant spellings&quot;&gt;Misspellings, common misspellings and variant spellings&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2011-02/Renaming CFI section for spellings]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rare misspellings should be excluded while common misspellings should be included.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2014-04/Keeping common misspellings]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no simple hard and fast rule, particularly in English, for determining whether a particular spelling is “correct”. Published grammars and style guides can be useful in that regard, as can statistics concerning the prevalence of various forms.

Most simple typos are much rarer than the most frequent spellings. Some words, however, are frequently misspelled. For example, ''occurred'' is often spelled with only one ''c'' or only one ''r'', but only ''occurred'' is considered correct.

It is important to remember that most languages, including English, do not have an academy to establish rules of usage, and thus may be prone to uncertain spellings. This problem is less frequent, though not unknown, in languages such as Spanish where spelling may have legal support in some countries.

Regional or historical variations are not misspellings. For example, there are well-known differences between British and American spelling. A spelling considered incorrect in one region may not occur at all in another, and may even dominate in yet another.

[[combining character|Combining character]]s (like [[́|this]]) should exist as main-namespace redirects to their non-combining forms (like [[´|this]]) if the latter exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2011-06/Redirecting combining characters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflections===
The entries for such inflected forms as {{m|en|cameras}}, {{m|en|geese}}, {{m|en|asked}}, and {{m|en|were}} should indicate what form they are, and link to the main entry for the word ({{m|en|camera}}, {{m|en|goose}}, {{m|en|ask}}, or {{m|en|be}}, respectively, for the preceding examples). Except with multi-word idioms, they should not merely redirect.

At entries for inflected forms with idiomatic senses, such as {{m|en|blues}} and {{m|en|smitten}}, predictable meanings should be distinguished from idiomatic ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-08/Inclusion of regular inflected forms]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repetitions===
Attested repetitive words formed by repeating letters or syllables in other attested words for emphasis, and having no other meaning in any language shall be treated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2014-01/Treatment of repeating letters and syllables]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Each attested repetitive form that has no more than three repetitions shall have an entry.
# Each attested repetitive form that has more than three repetitions shall be hard-redirected to the entry having three repetitions. The three-repetition entry shall have a usage note indicating that additional instances of the letter or syllable may be added for the purely literary effect of indicating emphasis.

An example of repeated letters is the repeated &quot;e&quot; in &quot;pleeease&quot; and &quot;pleeeeeease&quot; compared to &quot;please&quot;.

An example of repeated syllables is the repeated &quot;ha&quot; in &quot;hahahahaha&quot; compared to &quot;hahaha&quot;.

As for repetition counting: &quot;hahaha&quot; is considered to have three repetitions, while &quot;haha&quot; has two repetitions.

To hard-redirect is to use &quot;#REDIRECT&quot;, which immediately takes the reader to the target page.

The above treatment may be overriden by consensus, for example where a variation having four repetitions is more common, or where an additional repetition would cause the word to shift to a different pronunciation or intonation.

==Idiomatic phrases==
Many phrases take several forms. It is not necessary to include every conceivable variant. When present, minor variants should simply redirect to the main entry. For the main entry, prefer the most generic form, based on the following principles:

===Pronouns===
Prefer the generic personal pronoun ''one'' (''one's'') when an action is usually reflexive, and ''someone'' (''someone's'') when an action is usually not reflexive. Thus, {{m|en|feel one's oats|feel one’s oats}} (preferable to ''feel his oats''), {{m|en|breathe down someone's neck}}. Use of other personal pronouns, especially in the singular, should be avoided except where they are essential to the meaning.

===Articles===
Omit an initial article unless it makes a difference in the meaning. E.g., {{m|en|cat's pajamas|cat’s pajamas}} instead of {{m|en|the cat's pajamas|the cat’s pajamas}}.

===Verbs===
Use the infinitive form of the verb (but without “to”) for the principal verb of a verbal phrase. Thus for the saying ''It’s raining cats and dogs,'' or ''It was raining cats and dogs,'' or ''I think it’s going to rain cats and dogs any minute now,'' or ''It’s rained cats and dogs for the last week solid'' the entry should be (and is) under {{m|en|rain cats and dogs}}. The other variants are derived by the usual rules of grammar (including the use of ''it'' with weather terms and other [[impersonal verb]]s).

===Proverbs===
A proverb entry's title begins with a lowercase letter, whether it is a full sentence  or not.  The first word may still be capitalized on its own: 
* {{m|en|you can't judge a book by its cover}}
* {{m|en|Rome wasn't built in a day}}

==Languages to include==

===Natural languages===
All natural languages are acceptable. However, it is important to note that the question of whether a proposed language is considered a living language or a dialect of or alternate name for another language is inherently subjective in some cases, and either designation may have political overtones.

====Sign languages====
Terms in signed languages are acceptable as entries, and should be entered as described in the policy document [[Wiktionary:About sign languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-08/Wiktionary:About sign languages]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructed languages===
Constructed languages have not developed naturally, but are the product of conscious effort in the fulfillment of some purpose.

All constructed languages are excluded from the main namespace except for '''[[Esperanto]]''', '''[[Ido]]''', '''[[Interlingua]]''', and '''[[Volapük]]'''.

Some individual terms from constructed languages have been adopted into other languages. These should be treated as terms in the adoptive language, and the origin noted in the etymology, regardless of whether the constructed language as a whole is included.

Other constructed languages should not be included as entries or translations in the main namespace, but may have lexicons in the [[Appendix:Contents|Appendix]] namespace at the community's discretion. One use in a durably archived source is the minimum attestation required for an individual entry in an appendix-only constructed language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2020-12/CFI for appendix-only conlangs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstructed languages===
{{also|Wiktionary:Reconstructed terms}}
Terms in reconstructed languages such as [[Proto-Indo-European]] do not meet the criteria for inclusion. They may be entered in the Reconstruction namespace, and are referred to from etymology sections.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/2015-09/Creating a namespace for reconstructed terms]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusions==

===Fictional universes===
{{shortcut|WT:FICTION}}
{{also|Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion/Fictional universes}}
Terms originating in fictional universes which have three citations in separate works, but which do not have three citations which are independent of reference to that universe may be included only in appendices of words from that universe, and not in the main dictionary space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-01/Appendices for fictional terms]]&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to names of persons or places from fictional universes, they shall not be included unless they are used out of context in an attributive sense.

For purposes of defining a single work, a series of books, films, or television episodes by the same author, documenting the exploits of a common set of characters in a fictional universe (e.g. the ''Harry Potter'' books, Tolkien's Middle Earth books, the ''Star Wars'' films), shall be considered a single work in multiple parts.

:''The vote &quot;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-10/Disallowing certain appendices|pl-2010-10/Disallowing certain appendices]]&quot; is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-10/Disallowing certain appendices]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wiktionary is not an encyclopedia===
{{also|Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not}}
Care should be taken so that entries do not become [[encyclopedic]] in nature; if this happens, such content should be moved to [[Wikipedia]], but the dictionary entry itself should be kept.

Wiktionary articles are about words, not about people or places. Articles about the specific places and people belong in Wikipedia.

===Sarcastic usage===
The straightforward [[sarcastic]] use of [[irony]], [[understatement]] and [[hyperbole]] does not usually qualify for inclusion. This means, for example, that {{m|en|big}} should not be defined as “(''ironic'') [[small]]”, “(''understatement'') [[gigantic]]” or “(''hyperbole'') moderately [[large]]”. Common rhetorical use can be explained in a usage note, a context tag (such as (''usually sarcastic'')) or as part of the literal definition. Terms which are seldom or never used literally (e.g. {{m|en|fat chance}}) are not covered by this rule, and can be included on their own merits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2015-03/Excluding most sarcastic usage from CFI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language-specific issues===
Individual languages may have additional restrictions on inclusion. These will be mentioned on that language's About page. For instance, [[Wiktionary:English entry guidelines]] notes that the community has voted&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2007-07/Exclusion of possessive case]]&lt;/ref&gt; to not allow most modern English possessives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-01/Removing Modern English possessive forms section from CFI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical formulae===
{{shortcut|WT:CHEM}}
All chemical formulae are Translingual. To be included, chemical formulae must be attested in publications that (1) are not written for a scientific or technical audience; (2) don't make clear that they're formulae by e.g. explicitly discussing chemical formulae or by listing their component parts; and (3) do not otherwise explain the meaning of the formula. So, a textbook saying &quot;AsH₃ is made up of an As and three H atoms&quot; wouldn't support AsH₃, but a murder mystery saying &quot;the air in his scuba tank had been replaced with CO2&quot; could support {{m|mul|CO₂}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2020-02/CFI for chemical formulae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
{{shortcut|WT:NAMES}}
Names fall into several categories, including company names, the names of products, given names, family names, and the full names of specific people, places{{,}} and things. Wiktionary classifies all as proper nouns, but applies caveats to each.

Generic terms are common rather than proper nouns. For example: {{m|en|Remington}} is used as a synonym for any sort of rifle, and {{m|en|Hoover}} as a synonym for any sort of vacuum cleaner. (Both are also attested family name words, and are included on that basis as well, of course.&lt;!-- SO this could use BETTER EXAMPLES --&gt;) {{m|en|Hamburger}} is used as generic term for a type of sandwich. One good rule of thumb as to whether a name has become a generic word is whether the word can be used without capitalization (as indeed {{m|en|sandwich}} was in the previous sentence&lt;!-- BUT that’s the WRONG EXAMPLE --&gt;).

===Brand names===
{{shortcut|WT:BRAND}}
{{also|Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion/Brand names}}
'''A brand name for a product or service should be included if it has entered the lexicon.'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2007-08/Brand names of products 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-02/Brand names and physical product 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from genericized trademarks, this is measured objectively by the brand name’s use in at least three independent durably archived citations spanning a period of at least three years. The sources of these citations:

# must be independent of any parties with economic interest in the brand, including the manufacturer, distributors, retailers, marketers, and advertisers, their parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates, at time of authorship; and
# must not identify any such parties.

If the term has legal protection as a trademark, the original source must not indicate such. The sources also must not be written:
# by any person or group associated with the type of product or service;
# about any person or group specifically associated with the product or service; or
# about the type of product or service in general.

The text preceding and surrounding the citation must not identify the product or service to which the brand name applies, whether by stating explicitly or implicitly some feature or use of the product or service from which its type and purpose may be surmised, or some inherent quality that is necessary for an understanding of the author’s intent.

===Given and family names===
'''Given names (such as {{m|en|David}}, {{m|en|Roger}}, and {{m|en|Peter}}) and family names (such as {{m|en|Baker}}, {{m|en|Bush}}, {{m|en|Rice}}, {{m|en|Smith}}, and {{m|en|Jones}}) are words, and subject to the same criteria for inclusion as any other words.''' Wiktionary has main articles giving etymologies, alternative spellings, meanings, and translations for given names and family names, and has two appendices for indexing those articles: [[Appendix:Names]], [[Appendix:Surnames/A]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-01/Renaming given name appendixes]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For most given names and family names, it is relatively easy to demonstrate that the word fulfills the criteria, as for most given names and family names the name words are in widespread use in both spoken communication and literature. However, being a name per se does not automatically qualify a word for inclusion. A new name, that has not been attested, is still a protologism. A name that occurs only in the works of fiction of a single author, a television series or a video game, or within a closed context such as the works of several authors writing about a single fictional universe, is not used independently and should not be included.

[[hypocoristic|Hypocoristics]], [[diminutive]]s, and [[abbreviation]]s of names (such as {{m|en|Jock}}, {{m|en|Misha}}, {{m|en|Kenny}}, {{m|en|Ken}}, and {{m|en|Rog}}) are held to the same standards as names.

===Genealogical content===
'''[[Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not|Wiktionary is not a genealogy database]].''' Wiktionary articles on family names, for example, are not intended to be about the people who share the family name. They are about the name as a word. For example: Whilst {{m|en|Yoder}} will tell the reader that the word originated in Switzerland (as well as give its pronunciations and alternative spellings), it is not intended to include information about the ancestries of people who have the family name Yoder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-01/Renaming CFI section on genealogic names]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names of specific entities===
{{shortcut|WT:NSE}}
This section regulates the inclusion and exclusion of names of specific entities, that is, names of individual people, names of geographic features, names of celestial objects, names of mythological creatures, names and titles of various works, etc.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;s&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-05/Names of specific entities]]&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-12/Names of individuals]]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the {{m|en|Internet}}, the {{m|en|Magna Carta}}, the {{m|en|Mona Lisa}}, the {{m|en|Qur'an}}, the {{m|en|Red Cross}}, the {{m|en|Titanic}}, and {{m|en|World War II}}.&lt;/div&gt;

A name of a specific entity must not be included if it does not meet the [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Attestation|attestation]] requirement. Among those that do meet that requirement, many should be excluded while some should be included, but there is no agreement on precise, all-encompassing rules for deciding which are which. However, policies exist for names of certain kinds of entities. In particular:

* No individual person should be listed as a sense in any entry whose page title includes both a given name or diminutive and a family name or patronymic. For instance, Walter Elias Disney, the film producer and voice of Mickey Mouse, is not allowed a definition line at ''Walt Disney''.
* Names of specific companies are subject to the “[[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Company names|Company names]]” section of this page.
* Names of fictional people and places are subject to the “[[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Fictional universes|Fictional universes]]” section of this page.
Place names are subject to the “[[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Place names|Place names]]” section of this page.

Such definitions as are included should be succinct rather than encyclopedic.

====Company names====
{{shortcut|WT:COMPANY}}
'''Being a company name does not guarantee inclusion.''' To be included, the use of the company name other than its use as a trademark (i.e., a use as a common word or family name) has to be attested.

====Place names====
The following place names should be included as long as they are attested:

*The names of continents.
*The names of seas and oceans.
*The names of countries.
*The names of areas or regions containing multiple countries (e.g., {{l|en|Middle East}}, {{l|en|Eurozone}}).
*The names of primary administrative divisions (states, provinces, counties, etc).
*The names of conurbations, cities, towns, villages and hamlets.
*Districts of towns and cities (e.g., {{l|en|Fulham}}).
*The names of inhabited islands and archipelagos.
*The names of other significant natural geographic features (such as large deserts and major rivers).

The editors have not yet reached a consensus as to whether or not the names of places and geographic features other than those listed above should be included in Wiktionary. There is currently no definition of &quot;significant natural geographic features&quot;, but by way of an example, the twenty largest lakes in the world by surface area would each qualify. It is hoped that the editors will develop criteria over time to provide greater clarity and address matters not currently covered (for example the names of streets, buildings, tunnels).&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2017-01/Policy on place names]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2017-03/CFI and place names cleanup]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* For a list of arguments for and against place names, see [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion/Place name arguments]].
* For a list of discussions about place names, see [[Wiktionary:Unresolved issues/Place names]].
* For a list of types of place names by country, see [[Wiktionary:Place names]].

==Issues to consider==

===Attestation vs. the slippery slope===
There is occasionally concern that adding an entry for a particular term will lead to entries for a large number of similar terms. This is not a problem, as each term is considered on its own based on its usage, not on the usage of terms similar in form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2016-02/Attestation vs. the slippery slope 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{shortcut|WT:&quot;|WT:QUOTE|WT:CITE}}

'''Quotations''', also called [[citations]], serve two purposes: they provide evidence that a word or sense exists (as required by [[WT:ATTEST]]), and they provide examples of how it is used (what {{l|en|register|id=language register}} it has, etc.) as part of the language. 

Quotations may be placed in entries or in the &lt;code&gt;Citations:&lt;/code&gt; [[Wiktionary:Namespace#Overview|namespace]]. In general, a few good and illustrative quotations should go directly in the entry, while other quotations (if there are very many) can go in the &lt;code&gt;Citations:&lt;/code&gt; namespace to avoid cluttering the entry. For example, a few quotations of {{m|en|parrot}} are available in that entry, and more are available at [[Citations:parrot]].

==How to choose a quotation==
Ideally, quotations should:

# Illustrate the term’s meaning by surrounding context, but without being too long — quotations where that word is the “star” of the sentence serve the reader better than lengthy passages which have the word incidentally buried in them;
# Extend the time range that we have quotations for, or fill long time gaps;
# Show the variety of contexts that a word is used in; and
# Show the variety of genres, regions{{,}} and registers that a word is used in.

In practice, it’s usually a lot of effort to meet all these goals at once.

All quotations should be from works written in the language of the word in question, followed by an English translation when appropriate. If a word is one which is known to have been coined in a specific work in another language (such as {{m|en|robot}}), that information should go in the etymology section rather than the quotations section.

In general, editors should add quotations that count toward [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Attestation|the attestation requirement for inclusion]], such as ones from dateable printed sources, especially printed works which have been digitized and hosted on sites like Google Books, indexes of periodicals, and [[s:Main Page|Wikisource]]. Usenet is also a valuable source of quotations. In general, the earliest reliably-dated quotation should be included whether or not it counts toward attestation requirements.

==Naming==
Inflected forms and alternative spellings can be cited as such, especially if their existence is in doubt, but it may be useful to gather their citations on the page for the lemma, also known as the “dictionary form”. To this end, {{temp|citations}} template can take multiple parameters to list all of the words which are being cited on a given citations page (see e.g. [[Citations:moose-misse]]), and other citation pages (e.g. [[Citations:moose-miss]]) can contain hard or soft redirects to that primary page.

==Linking==
Main entries can use {{temp|seeCites}} or {{temp|seemoreCites}} under a given sense, or under a [[Wiktionary:Entry layout#Basics|level four]] “Quotations” header, to link to citations pages. Those pages, in turn, should use {{temp|citation}} to link back to the mainspace entries of all words that are cited on them.

==How to format quotations==
Each citations page should be headed with the {{temp|citation}} template, which will link clearly back to the main entry. When citations are grouped by part of speech definition on a citations page, each definition should begin with a gloss formatted as a level three header. Such a gloss should be short while providing enough information to indicate to readers which sense a citation is for. The gloss heading can also optionally be followed by a usage {{temp|timeline}}, followed by the citations. An example of this can be found at [[Citations:parrot]].

Both in entries and on citations pages, quotations should be ordered from earliest to the most recent.

===Between definitions===
{{also|{{section link|Wiktionary:Entry layout#Example sentences}}|Wiktionary:Example sentences}}

The following is what the basic layout for quotations between definitions renders as:

# First definition.
#* '''Year''', Author, ''Source title'', Publisher, pages #–#:
#*: First quotation of '''word'''.
#*:: Translation [if applicable]
#* '''Year''', Author (indicate as translator or editor if not original author), ''Source title'', Publisher (and date of later edition), page #:
#*: '''Words''' of second quotation.
# Second definition.
#: etc.

The code which generated it is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
# First definition.
#* '''Year''', Author, ''Source title'', Publisher, pages #–#:
#*: First quotation of '''word'''.
#*:: Translation [if applicable]
#* '''Year''', Author (indicate as translator or editor if not original author), ''Source title'', Publisher (and date of later edition), page #:
#*: '''Words''' of second quotation.
# Second definition.
#: etc.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Important notes include:
# When quoting a short poem, article or other short work, double quotation marks are used to enclose titles (&lt;code&gt;“Title”&lt;/code&gt;) instead of italicization by two apostrophes (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''Title''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
# Typefaces should be as indicated. The year is always in bold, the title of the work in italics or, for shorter works, quotation marks.
# The illustration shows the marks that will ensure proper indentation.
# No blank lines are included within these entries. Blank lines in a numbered list will restart the numbering.
# In the quotation itself, the word being illustrated should be in bold.
# If applicable, provide a link to Wikipedia (format: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Elizabeth Smart (Canadian author)|Elizabeth Smart]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or {{tl|w|Elizabeth Smart (Canadian author)|Elizabeth Smart}}) for the author and a link to [[s:Main Page|Wikisource]] (format: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[s:title|title]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) for the work. Make sure the links point to the relevant pages on the other projects.
# The year should be that of the earliest edition known to use the word. Where feasible, the page number should be taken from the first edition, but if a later edition is used (e.g. paperback version, or digitised by Google Books), then the publication date should be added in parentheses after the publisher’s name. In these cases, publication details should reflect the work actually cited: do not give the name, location etc. of the publisher of the first edition if you are not citing it directly.
# Printing location, publisher and publication year should be given, but not other details like street addresses or connecting prose such as &quot;printed for&quot;.
# The date of the cited edition should be specified (if different from the date of writing/first publication), but not further descriptive details such as that it is a &quot;newly enlarged and corrected edition&quot; etc.
# If the quotation can be read online, some editors make the page number into a link to the online source, but this practice is contentious. Links within the entry can always be provided with ISBN numbers.
# Generally, the quoted text itself should not contain links. Some editors think that the quoted text, like example sentences devised by editors, should never contain links while others think links are useful when quotes contain uncommon words or when the quoted text was originally linked. A 2010 discussion [[Wiktionary talk:Quotations#Links in the body of quoted text|Links in the body of quoted text]] on the subject did not reach any conclusion about this.

An example, taken from {{m|en|gully}}:

# {{lb|en|Scotland|northern UK}} A large [[knife]].
#* '''1883''', [[w:Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson]], ''[[w:Treasure Island|Treasure Island]]'', page 139:
#*: With that I made my mind up, took out my '''gully''', opened it with my teeth, and cut one strand after another{{...}}

Quotations from Usenet should be formatted as in the entry '''[[rainburn]]''':

# {{lb|en|humorous}} A [[notional]] [[burn]] on the [[skin]] caused by [[excess]] [[exposure]] to heavy [[rain]].
#* '''1991''' June 13, “Mark Grundy” (username), “[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.frp/msg/97c9ff2b764e4ce5?q=rainburn Plot Seeds/Story: Undead of Purditory]”, in &lt;tt&gt;rec.games.frp&lt;/tt&gt;, ''Usenet'':
#*: It started with neck and upper body sores that looked a bit like '''rainburn''' - but usually they had only two or three of them.

Webster’s 1913 Dictionary uses quotations, but shows '''only''' the quote and the surname of the author, in that order. The specific work and year is listed for some authors at [[Wiktionary:Abbreviated Authorities in Webster]], but for others it will need to be researched and added which can be tedious and painstaking work. Using [[s:Main page|Wikisource]] or Google Books may help. Expanding the information on these quotes helps Wiktionary, but it is not mandatory. Simply put what you have in the proper order, and someone else can research the added details. In the absence of any information about the author or work, consider paraphrasing the quote as an example sentence instead.

===Under a Quotations header===
Longer lists of quotations may find a more appropriate place in a separate section, as they would hamper readability for people only interested in the definitions. Also, some quotations may use terms in ambiguous ways, such that it is not practical to sort them under a single definition-line.

The appropriate section title is “Quotations”, a level four heading. Please place the section under the relevant part of speech. Avoid commingling quotations for different parts of speech.

The format is largely the same:

{{rfc|en|Replace with examples using the quote-* templates}}
 &lt;nowiki&gt;====Quotations====
* '&amp;#39;'Year'&amp;#39;', Author, '&amp;#39;Work title&amp;#39;', Publisher, page #:
*: First quotation of '&amp;#39;'word'&amp;#39;'.
*:: Translation [if applicable]
* '&amp;#39;'Year'&amp;#39;', Author, '&amp;#39;Work title&amp;#39;', Publisher (publication date for later edition), page #:
*: '&amp;#39;'Words'&amp;#39;' of second quotation.
etc.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It may also be helpful to show a {{temp|timeline}} of the dates.

===Quotation templates===
We also have some quotation templates which have a rather large number of possible parameters, which can be used for books, songs, videos, journals and others. These templates are generally used between definitions. They may seem quite complicated at first to use, but you'll soon get the hang of them. Have a look at some below for more detail.

{{citation templates}}

There are also author-specific quotation templates, which begin with the prefix RQ:. This allows editors to avoid typing the same information hundreds of times and has the bonus that we can easily find, for example, all quotations from ''Romeo and Juliet'', if that's your cup of tea. An incomplete list with details can be found at [[Wiktionary:Quotations/Templates]]. A complete list can be found at at [{{fullurl:Special:PrefixIndex|prefix=RQ%3A&amp;namespace=10&amp;amp;hideredirects=1}} this page].

===Quotation gadgets===
A gadget, called [[MediaWiki:Gadget-QQ.js/documentation|Quiet Quentin]] is available. This gadget allows users to search Google Books for a term, and it creates quotations formatted to Wiktionary’s standards. A modified version of Quiet Quentin also exists which formats quotations using templates, as described at [{{fullurl:Wiktionary:Grease_pit/2020/July#Feedback_on_Quiet_Quentin_with_&amp;#123;&amp;#123;quote-text&amp;#125;&amp;#125;_templates}} this Grease Pit discussion].

==Index to templates==
Various templates are used to facilitate adding quotations from oft-cited authors. See [[/Templates]] for a list of these.
If you cannot find what you need there, you may be able to find it in [[:Category:English quotation templates]].

==Which date to use==
The date corresponds with original authorship, the time that the citation was put into the exact words quoted. Usually this will be given as the first year of publication. For a work published posthumously, the date is ''ante'' the year of the author's death. Preferably the work is a first edition, but otherwise the date of the edition should be placed in the edition section. In contrast, for quotations of translated works, where the translator is noted before the author, the year of translation is stated first. This is true even for borrowed or transliterated terms.

==Abbreviations==
Abbreviations should be avoided unless their usage is almost universal. The abbreviation ''et al.'' (for ''et alii/alia'' = and others) is permitted.

==Debated authorship==
If there is mainstream debate about who wrote a work, indicate this by listing all possible authors, or by listing the most likely author(s) and placing ''(uncertain)'' after their name(s). (As an example, there is mainstream debate about who wrote the ''Funeral Elegy''; the debate over who wrote ''Romeo and Juliet'' is not mainstream and Shakespeare’s works can be attributed to him without qualification.)

==Spelling and typography==
Generally, the original spelling of the word/phrase should be kept in the citation. In practice, however, this doesn't always happen. 

===Spelling===
Reproducing the spelling is important as some variations in spelling can drastically affect the meaning; for example, ''[[breath]]'' and ''[[breathe]]'' are different words. Because Wiktionary has separate entries for different spellings of the same word (such as ''[[hajduk]]'' and ''[[hayduck]]''), it is vital that the spelling of the word being defined is reproduced.

====Diacritics====
The presence or absence of [[diacritic]]s, and which diacritic(s) are used is important to copy accurately. The presence or absence of a diacritic ranges from a matter of stylistic choice which doesn’t affect the meaning at all, through shades of meaning, to being completely different words. For example:

*English {{m|en|cliché}} and {{m|en|cliche}}, are identical in meaning and connotations.
*In British English a {{m|en|café}} is usually a higher class establishment than a {{m|en|cafe}}
*In English the noun {{m|en|exposé}} is a different word from the verb {{m|en|expose}}

Where a diacritic cannot be represented by Unicode characters, the nearest representation that can be shown should be used. If there is a standard convention for the language and/or character in question then this should be followed.

====Ligatures and archaic letters====
When rendering modern English texts with [[ligature]]s and archaic letters, as a rule of thumb reproduce the following if they appear in the source text:

* {{l|en|Æ}} / {{l|en|æ}}
* {{l|en|Œ}} / {{l|en|œ}}
* {{l|en|Þ}} / {{l|en|þ}}
* {{l|en|Ð}} / {{l|en|ð}}
* {{l|en|ſ}} {{qualifier|optional}}

For other characters, reproduce them only if you think they affect the meaning. Otherwise, substitute appropriate modern characters.

For other languages, the importance of reproducing ligatures and other characters not used in modern English or the modern character set of that language varies. If you are uncertain, ask others their opinion in the [[WT:TR|Tea Room]] or on the talk page of the “About” page for that language (e.g. [[Wiktionary talk:About Greek]]).

You may find a citation at, for instance, ''[[think]]'' that was spelt ''[[thinke]]'' in the original work. There is currently no widespread consensus about what is preferred on Wiktionary, but according to [[Wiktionary:Votes/2020-09/Removing Old English entries with wynns|a vote in September 2020]], words spelled with a [[wynn]] ([[ƿ]] or [[Ƿ]]) in Old English are excluded as entries, even if they were originally spelled that way (quotations may still include the wynn). A similar case is with the [[long s]] ([[ſ]]), although no formal vote has been carried out as of December 2020. 

===Punctuation and spacing===
Generally it is important to reproduce the punctuation of the source accurately, as this can greatly impact the meaning. (Compare “Eats shoots and leaves” with “Eats''',''' shoots and leaves”.)

The number and width of spaces between words or sentences does not normally alter the meaning at all, and so we typically use only a single ASCII space when reproducing spaces on Wiktionary. 

Some older works include a (narrow) space before punctuation marks such as colons and semi-colons or between dots of an ellipsis. There is no policy on whether to include these or not, and so it is the individual editor’s choice. If a space is included, it should be a standard width non-breaking space &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;, as in the example below:
&lt;pre&gt;For some reason, old books sometimes have a space before a semi-colon&amp;nbsp;; like this&lt;/pre&gt;

===Line breaks===
The importance of line breaks to the meaning of the text is dependent on the type of work. Where it is important to reproduce them, the “[[¶]]” or “/” characters can be used, or an HTML line break can be used by writing &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

:* {{RQ:Dryden Aeneis|1}}
:*: The tracks '''averse''' a lying notice gave, &lt;br&gt; And led the searcher backward from the cave.

:* '''1671''', [[w:John Milton|John Milton]], ''[[w:Paradise Regained|Paradise Regained]]'':
:*: {{...}} / Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult, / Thy counsel would be as the oracle / '''Urim and Thummim''', those oraculous gems / On Aaron’s breast, or tongue of Seers old / &amp;mdash;

:* '''1995,''' Joe Simpson, ''This Game of Ghosts'', The Mountaineers Books, {{ISBN|0898864607}}:
:*: As Mark came out of the bathroom, I remembered my underpants. ¶ ‘Hey Mark, have you got my '''shreddies'''?’

====Prose====
The line breaks in the body text of a work of prose are almost always inconsequential to the meaning of the words. This is because they would occur in different places if the work were printed on different sized paper, in a different text size or in a different typeface. For this reason it is not usually important to render line breaks.

Where explicit line breaks are used in prose, for example to distinguish different speakers in a conversation, they should be reproduced. 

====Poetry====
In a poem, the line breaks are often an important part of the work. For example the verse structure, rhyming and or syllable patterns are often dependent on the line breaks. Normally therefore it is appropriate to reproduce all the line breaks in a poetic work. However where a long work has very long verses (for example epic poems) it will often be important just to denote the breaks of verses (although it would be unusual to require more than part of one verse of such a work for citation purposes). Which of these applies to the work is a judgement call for individual editors.

====Headlines and titles====
In all works, the headlines and sub-headlines of works are often chosen with a view to them fitting in the space available, and choosing where to break a line can have an impact on the importance placed upon certain words. It is a judgement call for the individual editor whether this was the case for the (sub-)headline in question, but where it was then it should be reproduced.

====Hyphenation====
Where a work uses hyphenation for words split across lines, these should normally only be reproduced where the line breaks are explicit (for example some words are purposefully split for rhymes or poetic meter).

The only exception to this is where the word being defined is hyphenated in this manner. In this case it should not be reproduced, but it should be noted in a HTML comment that the word was split across lines in the original. Where the word has alternate hyphenated and non-hyphenated spellings, where possible it is almost always best to cite from works where the word is not hyphenated for a line-break.

===Stylized text===
If a word or phrase appears boldfaced in the original text, then do not replicate the styling since boldface is used to highlight only the headword. Leave an HTML comment indicating the original styling, even if only the headword is boldfaced in the original.

If emphasis is needed, also note any substituted styling, for instance:

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;A ''defined term''&amp;lt;!--bold instead of italics--&amp;gt; is defined as such.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

If a word or phrase appears italicized in the original text, then replicate that styling. If the entire quotation must be italicized, leave a comment indicated that this is the correct intent. Other stylized text may be replicated or noted as best as possible.

===Typography===
Generally you should reproduce most typography as it is in the source, although this is less important than for the spelling and punctuation. 

As a rule of thumb the style of quotation marks and apostrophes (straight &quot; or curly “) used in the original should always be used on Wiktionary, as should hyphens and dashes (-- vs —), and any other typography that has an impact on the meaning of the words.

Where it is not possible or not easy to reproduce the typography using standard Unicode characters or simple HTML formatting then do not attempt to do so using other methods. If it is important to the meaning, then you should note in a comment how it is formatted in the original.

==Copyright==
Citation sentences should not be added to Wiktionary in a way that violates the copyright of the work from which they were taken. Generally, citation sentences taken from works under copyright protection will represent a very small portion of the work from which they are taken. It is likely that any individual citation sentence will either be a ''[[de minimis]]'' portion of the work (so small that copyright does not even apply to it), or will constitute a clear [[fair use]] of that portion of the work. It is still possible for citation sentences to infringe the copyright in a work if the citation sentence is very long and the work is very short (for example, an essay of a few pages), or if multiple citation sentences are taken from the same work.

Works that are already in the public domain are not subject to copyright protection, and can be used as sources for an unlimited number of citation sentences. Such works include:
# All works published in the United States before 1925.
# All documents produced by the U.S. government, including reports produced by federal agencies and opinions rendered by federal courts. (Works by state and local governments are usually not in the public domain.)
# All works created by a UK public body with Crown Status and commercially published before 1967.
# Any work that any private author has deliberately released into the public domain.

If there is any question as to whether the use of a citation sentence from a work under copyright will constitute a fair use of that work, then it is advisable to look for a citation sentence from a public domain source as an alternative.

====Usage notes====
* In some linguistic traditions, the term &quot;dialect&quot; is restricted to [[nonstandard]] [[lect]]s. In scholarly English usage, it refers to both standardized and [[vernacular]] forms of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McGregor|first=William|title=Linguistics: An Introduction|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2009|isbn=9781847063670|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The difference between a language and a dialect is not always clear, and often has more to do with political boundaries than with linguistic differences. It is generally considered that people who speak different dialects of the same language can understand each other, while people who speak different languages cannot, however, in some cases, people who speak different dialects of the same language are mutually unintelligible. Compare '''[[species]]''' in the biological sense.

#*: The '''freedom of speech''' and of the press which are secured by the First Amendment against abridgment by the United States are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a state. The safeguarding of these rights to the ends that men may speak as they think on matters vital to them and that falsehoods may be exposed through the processes of education and discussion is essential to free government. Those who won our independence had confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning and communication of ideas to discover and spread political and economic truth. {{...}} Abridgment of '''freedom of speech''' and of the press, however, impairs those opportunities for public education that are essential to effective exercise of the power of correcting error through the processes of popular government.

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|grammar}} A [[word]] that indicates an action, event, or state of being.
#: {{ux|en|The word “speak” is an English '''verb'''.}}
# {{lb|en|obsolete}} Any [[word]]; a [[vocable]].
#* {{RQ:South 12}}
#*: a '''Verb''' of the Singular
# {{lb|en|figurative}} An action as opposed to a trait or thing.
#: {{ux|en|Kindness is a '''verb''', not an adjective. You're only kind if you do kind things.}}
# {{lb|en|programming}} A named command that performs a specific [[operation]] on an [[object]].
#* '''1995''', Adam Denning, ''OLE Controls Inside Out'' (page 321)
#*: You can invoke the Properties OLE '''verb''' in many ways. The easiest way is to move the mouse over the border of the control until it becomes only a four-way pointer and then right-click.
#* {{quote-book|en|year=2016|author=Ada Gavrilovska|title=Attaining High Performance Communications: A Vertical Approach|passage=The InfiniBand '''verbs''', which are closely modeled in the “Gen2” interface, provide the functional specification for the operations that should be allowed on an InfiniBand compliant adapter.}}

====Usage notes====
Verbs compose a fundamental category of words in most languages. In an English clause, a verb forms the [[head]] of the [[predicate]] of the clause. In many languages, verbs uniquely [[conjugate]] for [[tense]] and [[aspect]].

====Quotations====
* '''2001''' — [[w:Eoin Colfer|Eoin Colfer]], ''Artemis Fowl'', p 221
*: Then you could say that the doorway exploded. But the particular '''verb''' doesn't do the action justice. Rather, it shattered into infinitesimal pieces.

# An [[#adjective|adjectival]] phrase or clause.
#* '''2013''', Harrie Wetzer, ''The Typology of Adjectival Predication'' (page 240)
#*: Within this line of reasoning, then, Tagalog is classified as a language in which '''adjectivals''' are essentially neutral between a nouny and a verby interpretation.

=Comments &quot;Voting&quot; for a Thesaurus in Wiktionary=
==First Comment==
BTW, I also think this project should be a thesaurus too.  --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]
==The Wiktionary entry for [[Wiktionary]] actually says it will include a Thesaurus==
To quote - &quot;A collaborative project to produce a free and complete dictionary and thesaurus in every language. &quot; 
Though, like everything else in Wiktionary even that could be redefined ! Who is the final arbiter of what the Wiktionary project is about ??--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 12:45, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:No one particular person - we tend to thrash things out in the beer parlour and come to some sort of agreement, especially on major changes such as this one.  It tends to be the more regular contributors who determine what happens, for two reasons: we are around a lot to continue the discussion and put our arguments over, and we are the ones who the changes will have the greatest impact on; that said, we aren't the ones who have the final say on what happens or what doesn't - any user who suggests a solution that is popular, effective, useful and consistent with the goals of Wiktionary is likely to win the day. &amp;mdash; [[User:Paul G|Paul G]] 18:02, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
==there is a case for having a separate thesaurus - Paul G==
::Well, there is a case for having a separate thesaurus, and we have touched on it here at some time in the past.  One of the arguments reason for having a separate thesaurus is to ensure consistency of synonyms.  At the moment, words with lots and lots of synonyms, especially slang terms, have in their entries variable numbers of these synonyms listed.  For example, a word with ''n'' synonyms would, ideally, have ''n'' &amp;ndash; 1 synonyms listed at each of the ''n'' entries for these words.  In practice, we have somewhat less than ''n'' &amp;ndash; 1 synonyms in the lists (in some cases, none at all).  This is not only inconsistent, but unwieldy: every time some comes up with a new synonym, it has to be added to the synonym lists for the other ''n'' entries.

::In the same way that rhymes have their own index (rather than listing all the rhymes for words in their entries), having a separate namespace or project would remove these shortcomings.  We already have it to a very small extent with the translations - when YYY means exactly the same as XXX, and XXX is the more common term, I routinely add add &quot;see XXX&quot; instead of providing translations.  Again, this helps to keep things consistent and more easily maintainable.

::&amp;mdash; [[User:Paul G|Paul G]] 14:22, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)


=Comments 'Voting' for  &quot;No Need&quot;=
==A &quot;No&quot; vote==
:Folks, like yourself apparently, are already putting synonyms into wiktionary. Which is good. There's no need for a separate namespace or project. --[[User:Eean|Eean]] 03:46, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Another &quot;No&quot; vote==
I vote that the WikiSaurus concept is:
#An interesting exercise.
#Not needed.
#Represents loss of data that belongs '''in the articles themselves'''.
#Does not link definitions, it links words, which can be very misleading or worse, '''incorrect'''.
#Better suited by a bot that lists synonym/antonym ''referees'' that do not link back to the ''referer''.
#Better suited by a bot that lists synonym/antonym references.
--[[User:Connel MacKenzie|Connel MacKenzie]] 06:00, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
*Response
**''Loss of Data'' - not one scrap of information has been lost, and plenty more added by the WikiSaurus entries. It has been reorganised. But, this is an electronic system, not a paper one, and some restructuring in this way is to be expected.--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 12:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
**A thesaurus is about linking senses/meanings, not words or definitions.
**A Thesaurus addresses more than synonyms and antonyms, it addresses related senses, maybe nouns, adjectives, adverbs etc. Cannot see how you can get a bot to link senses/meanings at all.--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 12:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::To rephrase what I said earlier (and you misunderstood):
:::This represents a loss of data '''from''' the article.
:::
:::Now, maybe I am just misunderstanding you or this solution.  Is the idea here to list wikisaurus entries in the synonyms and antonyms sections, instead of the synonyms and antonyms themselves?  
:::(Obviously, if you clarify that, then my other points are moot.  Each wikisaurus sense is linked by number to the definition sense it describes, just as synonyms now do, right?)  --[[User:Connel MacKenzie|Connel MacKenzie]] 20:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::::In general, I don't think I would remove the '''key''' synonyms and antonyms to put them into a WikiSaurus entry. I agree these should stay in the article. But, being a Wiki, even if I did remove them, I'm sure someone else with a different view would pu tthem back, and I wouldn't lose any sleep over that.
::::But, when the list of synonyms in an entry gets ridiculously long, like it was getting with &quot;fuck&quot; and it's synonyms, I think the list should be trimmed and replaced by a referral to the WikiSaurus entry. But again, it's a Wiki. If people don't like the trim, they'll put them back!

=Somewhere between &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;=
* The yes's give the N(N-1) argument, which is compelling, but misses the concept of the non-overlapping venn diagrams for related words. [[User:Eupedia|Eupedia]] 17:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
* The no's argue that the present system incorporates synonyms and related words already, but fail to solve the maintenance and completeness problem. [[User:Eupedia|Eupedia]] 17:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
==LSI software proposal==
I propose something in between, a software layer that allows: 
:a user to navigate the references in the syn/ant and related words sections using some kind of grouping heuristics such as latent semantic indexing (LSI), and; 

:an editor to immediately see the list of candidate related words (again using LSI, perhaps) and quickly select which ones he or she considers qualified to be listed in they syn, ant/ RW sections (which could be created automatically). [[User:Eupedia|Eupedia]] 17:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Severe improvements need to be made-PRhyu==

I agree that a thesaurus in Wikitionary would be very useful. However, there are certain flaws. for instance, when I looked at the list there were about fifty synonyms for &quot;sexual intercourse,&quot; and no words were up which I really needed. I propse, therefore, that the people thoroughly limit words which are not needed and get on with words that are actually used! I mean, it's all very interesting to know that &quot;sexual intercourse,&quot; can be replaced with &quot;martial knowledge,&quot; but it's not useful in actual life, is it? Another thing. Wikisaurus is currently hosted as a sub-part of Wikitionary, and makes searchers actually find the word they want, and click it. Doubtless, later it will be very frustrating for searchers to find the word they want from hundreds, no, thousands, of words.And secondly, I suggest that Wikisaurus be merged within Wikitionary to let searchers instantly find the words they want instead of having to go to Wikisaurus then double back.

=Considerations of How to Implement=
==Maveric149==
All that means is that we would also have ==Synonyms== and ==Antonyms== sections in addition to the ==Translations== section. Peace.--[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]
The Thesaurus section is a great idea by doing it the way you have suggested, but the translation needs to be thought about. Needs a long discussion before we can decided how to do it. I suppose haveing a section is fine and if its not a perfect translation then explain why. etc -fonzy
==Dog Example -fonzy==
:The thesaurus stuff is more complicated than I thought since one word can have multiple definitions. Synonyms and antonyms will therefore need to be inline with the specific definitions. See [[dog]]. --mav

Hmmmm maybe something like

Dog - 

1)an animal thing

2)Name for a woman

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Thesaurus===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

1)Canine,

2)Bitch

Hm, that just may work. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

:Actually that might be a problem since words like [[dog]] can be both a noun and a verb (thus there would be two numbered lists). --mav

::The functional subsections should probably belong to each meaning/usage separately. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

:::So would the [[dog]] example be a good one then? --mav


I did create a test page for an idea i have suggested before:[[Thesaurus:Dog]].

-fonzy

==Two different sections of wiktionary==
&quot;Idea&quot; maybe there can be 2 different sections of wiktionary, wiktionary.org/wiki/D:Dog for the dictionary, and wiktionary.org/wiki/T:Dog for the thesaurus.

==a thesaurus links between '''definitions''' - nichtich==
First of all a thesaurus links between '''definitions''' and not between words (as mentioned above). Secondly you should agree on the kind of relationships:
* Synonyms (''BTW there are very litte real synonyms - most of them are only similar'')
* Antonyms
* Upper terms/Narrower terms?
** Class/Instance?
* or just simple links (related terms) like in the examples?

'''Note:''' A thesaurus is much more than what you know from word processors! 

I suggest only two or three types of thesaurical links: 
* antonyms (&lt;tt&gt;'''not:'''&lt;/tt&gt;)
* similar word (&lt;tt&gt;'''syn:'''&lt;/tt&gt;)
* related terms (&lt;tt&gt;'''see:'''&lt;/tt&gt;)
* (maybe) upper/narrower term (&lt;tt&gt;'''UT:'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''NT:'''&lt;/tt&gt;)

Everything more is too complicated (see [[w:WordNet]]) and leads to a wikithesaurus which is not a wiktionary anymore.
===dream example===
Suggestion (example from WordNet - i don't like dog/2):

&lt;nowiki&gt;==== dream ====&lt;/nowiki&gt;# a series of mental images and emotions occurring during sleep
#* syn: imagination, imaging, imagery, mental imagery
#* see: mind's eye, vision, picturing, envisioning, chimera, evocation, pretense
#* not: reality
# a cherished desire
#* syn: desire 
...
# have a daydream; indulge in a fantasy
#* syn: daydream, woolgather, stargaze
#* see: imagine, conceive of, ideate, envisage
#* see: visualize, envision, forsee, fantasize, prefigure, think

--- [[User:Nichtich|nichtich]]

==idiom dictionary==
As soon as the thesaurus contains two-word or longer phrases, it becomes almost impossible to distinguish this function from that of an [[w:idiom dictionary]].

The two functions should be considered together.  See discussion in [[Idiom_dictionary_considerations]], which could cross-fertilize well with this one.

==Wiktionary article per sense or synset - AxelBoldt==
I think it would be nice if Wiktionary were both a thesaurus and a dictionary, but the two are indeed quite different:
* a dictionary describes ''words'', complete with pronunciation, etymology and usage.
* a thesaurus describes ''senses'' (or ''synsets'' as [[w:WordNet]] calls them: sets of synonymous words). 
It seems like there should be one Wiktionary article per word (dictionary), and one Wiktionary article per sense or synset (thesaurus). Of course the dictionary page about a word would link to all its senses or synsets, as would the pages of all its synonyms. Translations to other languages seem to be more logically located at the sense (thesaurus) level rather than at the word (dictionary) level. At the thesaurus level, one could then also mention the various semantic relationships that WordNet recognizes, such as holonym, meronym etc. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 20:26 Jun 24, 2003 (UTC)

==14 different relationships on WordNet (Thesaurus, Schmesaurus)==

The [http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=19149&amp;u=106258&amp;m=5222&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=&gt; Visual Thesaurus] is based on WordNet and it shows, I think, 14 different relationships including ''part of'', ''member of'', ''made of'' and other amazing connections that no thesaurus gives.  I just discovered that it '''does''' have compound terms as well, which I had thought WordNet omitted.

Try it on the word ''law'' and then pull it around and see all the connections, to police to Scotland Yard, to Newton.

Yes, you need to have BT, NT, RT, ''See'', and ''See also'' relationships and, yes, there is no such thing as true synonymy (even ''lawyer'' is not the same as ''attorney'' because you can be a lawyer but you need to have a client to be an ''attorney'') but for real power and usefulness in the coming Semantic Web, you want more than a dictionary, more then a thesaurus, you want an '''ontology'''.

==An idea towards a WikiSaurus, with experiment / examples - Richardb==
Can we have Wiktionary pages named like [[WikiSaurus:sexual intercourse]] where all the synonyms, anotnyms etc of Sexual Intercourse are listed (and boy are there a few!), instead of having to enter the Synonyms and Antonyms, and Relateds etc, in every word that is an Synonym of Sexual Intercourse.

Of course, there is a difficulty in  who decides which words are the KEY words, but can we get around that somehow ? We can always vote for deleting unnecessary duplicates--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 12:03, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've set up a couple of pages towqrds an experiment / example. See
*[[todger]]
*[[WikiSaurus:penis]]
*[[dick]]
*[[cock]]
*[[penis]]
*[[sexual intercourse]]
*[[WikiSaurus:sexual intercourse]]

Also check &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Wikisaurus]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for a dynamic list of WikiSaurus articles.

:Now that I see what you mean, I agree, it makes sense. I'm not sure about the wikisaurus name though. Maybe just thes: or thesaurus: even. --[[User:Eean|Eean]] 01:39, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::Hi Richardb,
::You showed me quite recently that the Project namespace is dynamic.  Perhaps I would object less to the WikiSaurus concept if this were moved there, and in either the &lt;nowiki&gt;===Synonyms=== section or even the ===Thesaurus===&lt;/nowiki&gt; section, the WikiSaurus entries were embedded, using for example, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Project:WikiSaurus:drunk}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; inside each of the terms it refers to.&lt;!--Yes, I know this is a run-on sentence!--&gt;  Can this be tried with one entry (perhaps drunk is a horrible example, having so many entries) so we can see if this would make it any easier, '''without''' losing anything from the articles themselves?  --[[User:Connel MacKenzie|Connel MacKenzie]] 21:28, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==Wiktionary software needing to be overhauled - Blade Hirato==
:This essentially gets down to the Wiktionary software needing to be overhauled. I've been making a memorandum of all these ideas and their comments. I'll eventually get around to posting a Wiktionary RFC on Meta-Wiki for the future developers, if any. --[[User:Blade Hirato|Blade Hirato]] 09:29, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: Can't quite see how the software needs to be amended. Don't think an auto-generated Thesaurus is feasible, if that is what you were contemplating--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 07:02, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: It's probably been mentioned before, but I think the wiktionary needs more structure. Editing an entire article in one big text box works for wikipedia, but maybe the wiktionary should have a bunch of clearly defined sections to edit: Name, (noun/verb/etc), pronunciation, etymology, definition, adjectives, and translations. These would be edited from single-line text boxes, or something. Then, the search box on the left could have a bunch of search boxes, one for each of the sections, and you could do really effective searches: a verb, a synonym of this, with this in it's etymology. (But it would need a complete rebuilding of the search engine, and it might take a lot of computer resources. I don't know.) Users (or anyone, with cookies) could specify what sections they like to view (ex - need a thesaurus? Just close all the sections except for synonyms.) Like this, we wouldn't need a separate thesaurus, and everyone could customize their wiktionary as they like. --[[User:64.110.250.141|64.110.250.141]] 18:31, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)  (Sorry, this probably wasn't the best place to mention this...)

==Category implementation==

How about implementing this using categories?  This is just a bit of a brainstorm, and the words I've used as examples may be incorrect, but here's how it might work.  

In the entry for [[stiff]] (as an example) you might include &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:headword:hardness]] and [[category:headword:corpse]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; which would cause it to show up under both headwords.  These categories would be sub-categories within a hierarchy so that you could find information in a top-down approach too, however I would imagine the main use would be to look up a word and then look for synonyms/antonyms etc. from there.

In practice, I would suggest wrapping the category headings in a template, so you could use something like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{hw|hardness}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to produce something like this :
:''Use Wikisaurus to look up alternative words to '''stiff''' under the headword [[:category:headword:hardness|hardness]].''
I hope I've got the syntax right:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;:''Use Wikisaurus to look up alternative words to '''{{PAGENAME}}''' under the headword [[:category:headword:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]].''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:headword:{{{1}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The category page itself could include whatever other text is desirable (it should not be the definition of the headword however).  Possibly even a concise thesaurus-like listing of the related words.  Although this is duplication of the list that appears below it, this will make the entry easier to read, allow us to include words for which we don't currently have articles and let us break the list down by type of word (synonym, antonym etc).  The main purpose of the categorisation if this is the case would be to lead people to the headword article, rather than the creation of a list.

Alternatively a convention of using a piped category link to apply order could be adopted, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:headword:hardness|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''s'''&lt;nowiki&gt; stiff]] and [[category:headword:softness|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''a'''&lt;nowiki&gt; stiff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, with '''s''' meaning synonym, and '''a''' meaning antonym, and with other letters for the other word types we want to include.  This would cause all synonyms to be listed together, in alphabetical order, under s, all antonyms under a, etc. It would not work so well if there are many items of each type, but if the lists are short then this could be an option.

I think there are various possible ways of implementing a thesaurus using categories which would need to be discussed, but that's just a few late-night ideas from the top of my head. Thoughts? --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 04:06, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)


It looks pretty useful, though perhaps a bit complex to catch on much. But I do worry about the overuse of categories. Having thousands of categories can make the category system unworkable/unusable.

I tried linking WikiSaurus entries to [[Appendix:Rogetâs thesaurus classification|Wiktionary:Roget Thesaurus Classification]]
. See [[WikiSaurus:mad person]] as an example.
--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 16:49, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)


:Actually, I would have thought simply adding '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{hw|hardness}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', or even '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{hw|s hardness}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to an article is pretty easy!  Much easier than having to enter the full taxonomy, as is the case in your example.  Once the template is in place the casual user should be able to use it transparently.  The only complication is knowing which headword to place it under, but I imagine that will be a problem with all suggestions. --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 03:33, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

The primary task of a thesaurus is to find the exact word you want, at least for me.  A paper thesaurus is typically organized using categories, with an alphabetical index.  If you know you're looking for a word like &quot;formidable&quot;, you look it up in the aphabetical index, which refers you to a list of numbered categories, eg, &quot;37: War&quot;.  And then you'd see formidable listed under the &quot;adjectives&quot; section of the category, that would list the adjectives relating to war.  The adjectives themselves would be grouped into sub-categories (37.1: Adjectives that describe the intensity of war; 37.2, adjectives that describe the attitudes of war; and so on, until 37.8, which would be adjectives that don't describe war, ie antonyms, such as &quot;peaceful&quot;.  37.9 might be the first subcategory containing nouns.)  The categories are numbered in such a way that related words are more likely to appear in close proximity.  So, if the word I really wanted was &quot;adamant&quot;, but the only thing I could remember was &quot;formidable&quot;, the paper thesaurus is still a useful tool, because it's likely that adamant might appear in category 36 or 38.  I'm going into this horrible level of detail because I have never seen an online thesaurus, whether on the web or integrated into a word processor, that was as useful as a paper thesaurus.  Most online versions let you type in a word, and present you with either a single list of synonyms, or a list of categories that you can drill down into.  That's useless.  What you really want is to provide a huge list, filling the whole screen with related words.  By all means, break them down into categories and subcategories, but please display more than one such category on the page.  Using # anchors you can center the screen on the most relevant category and let the user scroll from there.  I particularly dislike the WordNet approach of finding words:  It presents you with a very small list of words and lets you &quot;narrow&quot; or &quot;widen&quot; or &quot;find rhymes&quot; and so on.  This doesn't work for me when I'm hunting for a word -- given such a hyperstructured thing to navigate, how do you find &quot;adamant&quot; starting from &quot;formidable?&quot;  Do you narrow or widen or what?   It's non-intuitive.  Whatever model you use to organize synonyms in Wiktionary, please look to the paper versions for their wisdom.  I personally would love to see an online thesaurus organized like the paper Bartlett's/Roget's, that displayed multiple categories containing hundreds of words near each other.  In this hypothetical system, clicking on a word would take you to its definition page.  To get a new list of words, you'd do a new Thesaurus search.  To this end, having a separate Wikisaurus seems like a good idea.  However, its current implementation doesn't work for me.  It's the Microsoft Word version of &quot;enter a word and get a small list&quot;.  That's not very useful for a poet.

==Wikibooks might ban thesaurus content==
&lt;s&gt;Wikibooks ([[wikibooks:Main Page|main page]], [[wikibooks:Wikibooks:About|about]]) recently put [[wikibooks:Body parts slang]] (orig [[wikipedia:Body parts slang]]) at [[wikibooks:WB:VFD|votes for deletion]]. I am a Wikibooks contributor who voted for deletion after believing that &quot;Body parts slang&quot; was mostly thesaurus content, and noticing that Wikibooks has [[Wiktionary:Wikisaurus|a thesaurus]]. I am also trying to change Wikibooks policy ([[b:Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]: &quot;Wikibooks is not a dictionary&quot; with reference to Wiktionary) to claim that ''Wikibooks is not a thesaurus''. My concerns are:&lt;/s&gt;
#&lt;s&gt;Does [[wikibooks:Body parts slang]] seem suitable for Wiktionary? I want to avoid the scenario where stuff moves from [[w:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]] to [[b:Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] to [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]].&lt;/s&gt;
#&lt;s&gt;Wikibooks might write &quot;not a thesaurus&quot; into policy even while Wiktionary lacks a thesaurus policy.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;s&gt;I hope that WikiSaurus contributors comment on this. --[[MetaWikipedia:User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:07, 30 October 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

Someone copied it from Wikipedia to [[Transwiki:Body parts slang]]. &quot;Wikibooks is not a thesaurus&quot; will probably become policy soon. --[[MetaWikipedia:User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]

=Capturing Multiple Relations, but also Being Useful=

If we'd like a thesaurus that is both useful and new, something that isn't merely a copycat imitation of existing paper-based thesauruses, but really capitalizes on the greater flexibility we've got in an all-electronic design, I think we want to make sure we're broadly accommodating of all the various relationships between words, not just simple synonyms and antonyms, but certainly weak/related/suggestive sorta-synonyms, and then potentially all the funky meronyms and holonyms and the 14 other Wordnet relations, too.  But of course an important challenge will be make sure that the funky obscure relations don't obscure the familiar ones, to make sure that an unsophisticated reader  just looking for simple synonyms and antonyms won't be overwhelmed.

But there was an exremely important comment made a year ago by 216.38.149.153 pointing out that one big use (me, I'd even say ''the'' big use) of a thesaurus is finding that perfect word that you can't quite remember but that you know when you see it.  But as 216.38.149.153 pointed out, a too-logical, too-structured, too-mechanical system doesn't do that for you:

: &quot;I have never seen an online thesaurus that was as useful as a paper thesaurus. Most online versions let you type in a word, and present you with either a single list of synonyms, or a list of categories  that you can drill down into. That's useless... It's the Microsoft Word version of &quot;enter a word and get a small list&quot;. That's not very useful for a poet.&quot;

So we've got to capture those &quot;near&quot; and &quot;similar&quot; and &quot;related&quot; and &quot;you might also be thinking of&quot; relations as well.  There are several ways to approach this, I think:

#Make sure we've got &quot;similar to&quot; and &quot;related to&quot; and &quot;you might also be thinking of&quot; as relations.
#Make sure we're integrated with a Roget-like, concept-based, sense-and-meaning classification hierarchy, which is somehow also browsable.
#Do implement sets or lists of near-synonymous words (perhaps precisely what Wordnet calls &quot;synsets&quot;), but then work on ways of linking and grouping them.

With respect to #3, Roget does a ''lot'' of this.  For example, here's an entry picked somewhat at random:

: #740. Lenity.-- N. lenity, lenience, leniency; moderation &amp;c. 174; tolerance, toleration; mildness, gentleness; favor, indulgence, indulgency; clemency, mercy, forbearance, quarter; compassion &amp;c. 914.

Notice that there are a bunch of little lists there, with semicolons between them.  More importantly, notice the cross-references to other related entries.  When I use a paper-based thesaurus, I often find myself chasing those all over the place.  And they're obviously much easier to create and maintain -- not to mention to use! -- in a hyperlinked electronic format like this.

—[[User:Scs|Scs]] 05:13, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

: Here's a much more extensive example from Roget, showing a three-level internal hierarchy (comma, semicolon, full stop):

:: #837. Dejection. --
:: ...
:: Adj. cheerless, joyless, spiritless; uncheerful, uncheery[obs3]; unlively[obs3]; unhappy &amp;c. 828; melancholy, dismal, somber, dark, gloomy, triste[Fr], clouded, murky, lowering, frowning, lugubrious, funereal, mournful, lamentable, dreadful.
:: dreary, flat; dull, dull as a beetle, dull as ditchwater[obs3]; depressing &amp;c. v.
:: &quot;melancholy as a gib cat&quot;; oppressed with melancholy, a prey to melancholy; downcast, downhearted; down in the mouth, down in one's luck; heavy-hearted; in the dumps, down in the dumps, in the suds, in the sulks, in the doldrums; in doleful dumps, in bad humor; sullen; mumpish[obs3], dumpish, mopish[obs3], moping; moody, glum; sulky &amp;c. (discontented) 832; out of sorts, out of humor, out of heart, out of spirits; ill at ease, low spirited, in low spirits, a cup too low; weary &amp;c. 841; discouraged, disheartened; desponding; chapfallen[obs3], chopfallen[obs3], jaw fallen, crest fallen.
:: sad, pensive, penseroso[It], tristful[obs3]; dolesome[obs3], doleful; woebegone; lacrymose, lachrymose, in tears, melancholic, hypped[obs3], hypochondriacal, bilious, jaundiced, atrabilious[obs3], saturnine, splenetic; lackadaisical.
:: serious, sedate, staid, stayed; grave as a judge, grave as an undertaker, grave as a mustard pot; sober, sober as a judge, solemn, demure; grim; grim-faced, grim-visaged; rueful, wan, long-faced.
:: disconsolate; unconsolable, inconsolable; forlorn, comfortless, desolate, desole[Fr], sick at heart; soul sick, heart sick; au desespoir[Fr]; in despair &amp;c. 859; lost.
:: overcome; broken down, borne down, bowed down; heartstricken &amp;c (mental suffering) 828[obs3]; cut up, dashed, sunk; unnerved, unmanned; down fallen, downtrodden; broken-hearted; careworn.

==Another relation?==

Another sort of &quot;relation&quot; which might be captured, not applicable to all words but useful and interesting for those it does apply to, is position in and connection with neighbors along a spectrum.  I haven't seen a &quot;-nym&quot; term for this.  For example, two such spectra are freezing/cold/chilly/cool/neutral/tepid/warm/hot/scalding/incandescent and terrible/bad/lousy/poor/neutral/fair/middling/good/excellent. —[[User:Scs|Scs]] 05:53, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

That sounds like an excellent extension of WikiSaurus. This sort of extension to some extent validates using a new name, rather than just using the title thesaurus, as we can go much further than a usual Thesaurus, just as Wiktionary goes well beyond a normal dictionary.
I suggest &quot;creating&quot; a -nym word for this, to help us describe what is meant. If and when someone finds a real word to mean this, we can replace the occurrences of your made-up word with the real word. I've got some suggestions, but will leave to you the privilege of being creative about the word.--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 03:35, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

==Has WikiSaurus reached a scope above that of Thesaurus Considerations==
Whilst WikiSaurus is still as raw as can be, and controversial, has it already grown in scope above that of what might be termed &quot;Simple&quot; Thesaurus ? Should we call a close to this discussion of &quot;Thesaurus considerations&quot;, and have a place (or group of places) discussing the scope, ongoing development and improvement of WikiSaurus ? In no-way would this pre-suppose how WikiSaurus should be implemented (the present method is still a somewhat controversial trial exploring the possibilities). I'm just looking at trying to rationalise, centralise, focus the discussion of what we are increasingly calling &quot;The WikiSaurus&quot;, as opposed to talking about a Thesaurus and the WikiSaurus as two seprate conversations.--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 03:54, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

At this early stage in the project, it is in principle still possible to change the license from GFDL to something else. 
I would favor releasing Wiktionary texts into the [[w:public domain|public domain]]. This way, the maze of slightly incompatible licenses out there is radically cleared, and the attribution requirements of the GFDL, which are not quite clear anyway, would be avoided. If every article is seen as a separate GFDL work, then the GFDL requires for instance that the title of any article be changed if the article is modified. On the other hand, if the whole Wiktionary is seen as a single GFDL work, then anybody who uses articles from it has to acknowledge the main contributors to Wiktionary. See [[w:GFDL|GFDL]].

Of course, releasing the texts into the public domain implies that anybody can do anything with them, including republishing under a restrictive license.

Is there any support for releasing Wiktionary texts into the public domain? 
[[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 22:41 Dec 14, 2002 (UTC) &lt;br&gt;
:I have no moral problems with this, but a large practical impediment is that Wikipeda is GFDL, which means we could not use text from Wikipedia on Wiktionary. That would be pretty silly. While GFDL is kind of inconvenient at times, it's not too bad. I don't think any similar licenses would allow &quot;downgrading&quot; to public domain anyway, so I don't see how any license incompatibilities would be resolved. -- [[User:Merphant|Merphant]]

::Since Wikipedia is not a dictionary, the issue of moving texts over shouldn't 
come up very often. The incompabilities are resolved for ''users'' of 
Wiktionary texts: they could use the information in any way they see fit. 
[[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 
:::Think of [[Wiktionary:pictures|pictures]]. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]]
 
: Personally I wouldn't object to releasing it under a more liberal license 
than the GFDL, but I don't think using PD would help that much. Maybe the GPL 
is a solution (which can be applied to non-programs if the source is clearly 
defined, which in our case it is) --[[User:Imran|Imran]] 23:45 Dec 14, 2002 
(UTC) 
Using copyleft licenses like the GPL and GFDL is a deliberate political act that forces those who would profit freely from our labors to allow others to continue to derive the same profit from their additions. If Wiktionary is to use a different license than GFDL, it '''must''' provide the same type of protections or I will have nothing more to do with it. (Using a different license, of course, will complicate sharing content with Wikipedia.) Ultimately it's up to Jimbo (and if it's ever created, the Wikipedia Foundation) if it's to remain linked to the Wikipedia project and server. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 00:00 Dec 15, 2002 (UTC) &lt;br&gt;
I wouldn't contribute to a project knowing that somebody could steal and hijack my work and call it their own - as if I didn't exist or matter. The whole point of the GFDL is to ensure that text is ''free'' and will remain so ''forever''. 
Placing things into the public domain defeats this aim and worst, encourages others to fork our work instead of adding to it. --mav 
: Actually they can't, at least in the UK, a author has &quot;moral rights&quot; as well as &quot;copyrights&quot;, and the moral rights include to right to be acknowledged as the author. (Although authors have to assert their moral right, while copyright is automatic). --[[User:Imran|Imran]] 00:18 Dec 15, 2002 (UTC)

:In the US, expressly placing something in the public domain denies the author of any control of the public domain item. No more rights whatsoever. --mav

::Not quite true. Public domain means that everyone has the ''same'' rights to ''use''  a work. It doesn't mean that someone can claim to have they written something they did not, or that they can edit a work and claim you did it. I can't legally take a copy of Hamlet, backspace Shakespear's name off it, and put my own on instead. -- [[User:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]] 01:04 Dec 21, 2002 (UTC) &lt;br&gt;
But it wouldn't be &quot;stealing and hijacking&quot; if you freely invite them to it :-) 
Philosophically, one could argue that information can't be owned and therefore 
can't be hijacked or stolen. 
Public domain works also &quot;remain free forever&quot;; it's just the changes that 
someone else adds to them that could become non-free. 
[[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 
:However it is possible for a commercial entity to make a CD version of it or 
mirror it on their site and apply a restrictive license to it. Or they could 
merge it with a dictionary they are selling. It is the GFDL that produces a 
sense of community and encourages contribution. I very much doubt that 
Wikipedia would have grown so much if it had been in the public domain. I'm 
strongly against PD. -- [[User:Arvindn|Arvindn]] 09:10 Dec 20, 2002 (UTC)

::Agreed. A copyleft license is like a constitution and bill of rights; it may 
not always seem expedient, but it's there to protect your freedoms against 
abuse. One should not toss either away lightly. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]]

The public domain also allows projects like Wiktionary to start with a base of 
words and definitions from public domain dictionaries, without having to wring 
our hands about license incompatibilities. 
:''I don't see what you mean here; isn't it true that we can put any license we 
want on material derived from a public domain source? The original versions are 
still public domain, but modifications made here under our license are 
protected by our copyright and license. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]] 01:34 Dec 
21, 2002 (UTC)'' 
Both copyleft and the public domain have their place. I believe a copyleft 
license is best for this project. The GFDL isn't the only game in town. There's 
also the [http://www.dsl.org/copyleft/dsl.txt Design Science License] and the 
[http://opencontent.org/openpub/ Open Publication License]. However, there's no 
compelling reason to use either of these over the GFDL, and they would make 
Wiktionary incompatible with Wikipedia. If we want to avoid the complexity of 
the GFDL, there's the option of using the new Creative Commons 
[http://www.creativecommons.org/license/ license selector]. For example, here's 
a [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0-legalcode a simple copyleft 
license] that allows redistribution, modification and commercial use, while 
requiring attribution. -- [[User:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]] 01:04 Dec 
21, 2002 (UTC) -----

An alternative suggestion, use the GFDL but limit our copyright to say 10-20 
years, after all as things stand atm for practical purposes what we're 
developing now won't fall out of copyright for almost two centuries (probably 
around 2179 to be a bit more precise) by which time I expect most of us will be 
long long past caring what happens to Wiktionary. --[[User:Imran|Imran]]

:Not to worry, by then Microsoft-Sun-AOL-Time Warner-Apple will have bought the 
FSF and released a new version of the GFDL that allows them to reuse all GFDL'd 
material proprietarily without releasing it back to the community. Since all 
living human beings will be their employees, though, everyone will be free to 
use it as they wish. 
:Seriously, though; 'limiting our copyright' like that would mean that we can't 
import GFDL'd material from other sources, or the limit is contaminated and the 
exact provenance of each 20-year-old entry has to be researched by a future 
vulture to see if it's still protected. I don't think that's a practical 
solution; better to assume it's ''all'' protected and work to make that true. 
--[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]] 
:: Basically the only major sources of GFDL material are Wikipedia and FOLDOC, 
I don't think that we'll be using a significant amount from either of them. 
Including a term which releases it into the PD sometime into the future could 
be very useful if some flaw is found in the GFDL which stops development

::: ''Sure, and while we're raising specters of what could be, Congress 
'''could''' retroactively reassign copyright over all public domain material to 
the Disney Public Domain Repository Corporation. (We don't want to confuse 
people with all this legally copyable material! Keeping it around would require 
leaving copyable channels open, which is just one big loophole which evil 
hacker terrorist criminals can exploit to pillage poor helpless media 
corporations. Remember, Osama and Saddam LIKE it when you download warez, mp3z, 
and ripped DVDz!)'' 
:::: It's more likely then you think I've studied the GFDL in some depth at 
various times (for instance note the DTD section fails to require the 
Stylesheet to be GFDL and the lack of information on the handling of &quot;fair use&quot; 
material), the GFDL was designed for manuals and we're on dodgy grounds using 
it anyway, I'm happy enough using it for short term materials, but I think we 
need a get out clause in case a problem does come up. 
:: and it would also allow some else more freedom to take over if wiktionary 
fails. 
::: ''More freedom to not allow their new version to be copied freely? No 
thanks. We've already got non-free dictionaries.'' 
:::: To freely choose whatever license they want, be it free or non-free, if 
wiktionary fails I'd rather a non-free group took it over then no-one doing so 
and all of the effort we're putting in being wasted. If a Wiktionary survives 
then they have a twenty year head start, and bluntly if we can't in twenty 
years produce a better dictionary then someone who starts from the same point 
as us and produces a non-free dictionary in a few years then we have no 
business producing a dictionary. 
:: Also it'd be rather hypocritical of us to stop someone using our data 90 
years  in the future when we ourselves are using the 90 year old Webster as a 
basis. --[[User:Imran|Imran]]. 
:::''We're stopping no one -- they can always use our material freely as long 
as they share alike. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]]'' 
:::: No, they can use our material as long as they use the GFDL, they don't 
even have the ability to choose a more/less liberal copyleft license.

What would be the legal implications of copying between a GPL work and a GFDL 
work? There is a rather complete Esperanto dictionary at 
[http://purl.org/NET/voko/revo/] with many translations into national 
languages, licensed under the GPL. -- [[User:AdamRaizen|AdamRaizen]] 14:18 Jul 
8, 2003 (UTC) 

It must be too late to respond, but I face the same issue though, honestly 
speaking, I hate getting involved in legal problems. I searched on the net and 
found the following article: [http://lwn.net/Articles/30787/ When &quot;Free&quot; Isn't 
Good Enough]. This says that the GFDL is incompatible with the GPL. Due to the 
license incompatibility, it is difficult to embed GFDL-ed stuffs in a GPL-ed 
program. But I'm not sure if we have a trouble with incorporating GPL-ed 
documents into GFDL-ed ones. --[[User:Nanshu|Nanshu]] 00:37, 2 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Yes, those licenses are incompatible.

:Judging from that quote, you can only use that as a source and not as a basis 
for a derivated work.

Dunno what the Gnu Free Document License involves or implies, and I don't really have the time to get involved. However, you might wish to be aware that http://open-dictionary.com/ seems to basically be cc of Wiktionary content with Google ads strapped on.

:I am the developer of [http://open-dictionary.com/ Open Dictionary], and I find it disgusting that you label my efforts as a purposeful violation of the GNU FDL.

:If you consumed the same amount of time you placed in stating your 'copyright violation' note  (on this Wiki page) in viewing the Web site in general (frontpage, footers or term definition pages), you would notice I vividly label data sources correctly.

:On the frontpage, I explicitly declare:

:&quot;Welcome to open dictionary, a collaborative project to produce a freely accessible multilingual dictionary in every language, with meanings, etymologies and pronunciations with the aid of the [http://open-dictionary.com/i/about_wiktionary.html Wiktionary] project.&quot;

:The text 'Wiktionary' is linked to a Web page explaining what Wiktionary is along with the following clear sentence:

:The text label 'Zeeshan Muhammad' links to a Web page allowing Web users to contact the Web site maintainers (me) - on this Web page, I explicitly attempt to assist users who want to know the license terms by stating:

:&quot;If your enquiry addresses license issues regarding the information presented on open-dictionary.com, then you are advised to view our [http://open-dictionary.com/i/content_license.html legal notices] Web page.&quot;

:The legal notices' Web page contains rich license information which is human readable along with full license links to the GNU FDL and associated URLs.

:To further strengthen case that I attempted to follow the GNU FDL as carefully as possible (within technical coding boundaries), I also developed [http://users.open-dictionary.com/ users.open-dictionary.com] which states the contributors of Wiktionary

:Also, upon usage of Wiktionary content, I also made aware the Web user of the Wiki editing functions they had access to with the following clear textual statement:

:&quot;Found an omission? You can freely contribute to this [http://open-dictionary.com/i/about_wiktionary.html Wiktionary] article.&quot;

:Next to this sentence was an edit button which directly went to the edit section of the content in question to allow the user to contribute to Wiktionary.

Why is it that unlike the main commons, Wiktionaries do not require -- and at any rate don't display -- licensing information for picture/media uploads?  Is this intentional?  
:All the uploads are housed at Commons, so that's where the licensing information is kept.  We discourage local files, and prefer that everything (audio and graphic) be uploaded at Commons.  Clicking on the image will pull up the Commons page with the licensing info. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] 09:29, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|en|pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcano-coniosis}}
* {{l|en|pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis}}
* {{l|en|P45}}

===Etymology===
Coined by Everett K Smith, President of the {{w|National Puzzlers' League}}, at their convention in 1935. From {{der|en|grc|πνεύμων||lung}} + {{der|en|la|ultra||beyond}} + {{cog|en|microscopic}} + {{m|en|silico-}} + {{m|en|volcano}} + {{der|en|grc|κόνις||dust}} + {{cog|en|-osis}}, as an extension of the medical term [[pneumonoconiosis]].

====Usage notes====

* Cited as the longest word in the ''{{w|Oxford English Dictionary}}''. On July 14, 2017 sixteen-year-old Michael Bryan used the 45-letter word during a Youth Select Committee meeting to highlight the “grave inconsistency” of addressing health conditions, with physical problems given greater precedent than mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-40775470 &quot;Boy, 16, uses 'longest word' in Parliament&quot;]. ''www.bbc.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Oxford English Dictionary lists ''pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis'' as “a factitious word alleged to mean ‘a lung disease caused by inhalation of very fine silica dust usually found in volcanos’ but occurring chiefly as an instance of a very long word”.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED-pronstress&amp;usage&quot;/&gt;
* This word was invented purely to be a contender for the title of the longest word in the English language, comprising forty-five letters and nineteen syllables. The word is not in official medical usage, and textbooks refer to this disease as [[pneumonoconiosis]], [[pneumoconiosis]], or [[silicosis]].

===Etymology===
From {{confix|en|anti|disestablishmentarian|ism}}.

===Pronunciation===

* {{hyphenation|en|an|ti|dis|es|tab|lish|ment|ar|i|an|ism}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun|-|s}}

# A [[political]] [[philosophy]] [[opposed]] to the [[separation]] of a [[religious]] [[group]] (church) and a [[government]] (state), especially the belief held by those in 19th [[century]] [[England]] [[opposed]] to separating the Anglican church from the [[civil]] government or to refer to separation of church and state. {{defdate|from 20th c.}}
#* {{quote-text|en|year=1998|author=University of Oklahoma College of Law|title=American Indian Law Review|passage=Jed Rubenfeld, who actually may not have been recycling a ''Boerne'' Court- rejected argument into a law review article,&lt;sup&gt;450&lt;/sup&gt; reasoned that RFRA indeed lacked constitutionality, but because of First Amendment '''antidisestablishmentarianism''', and not the reasons offered by the Court.&lt;sup&gt;451&lt;/sup&gt;}}
#* '''2002''', Angela Hague and David Lavery (credited as editors, but truly authors of the compiled fictional reviews), ''Teleparody: predicting/preventing the TV discourse of tomorrow''
#*: The establishmentarianism of Hatch's alliance-building strategy undermined by the disestablishmentarianism of Wiglesworth's treachery triggers an '''antidisestablishmentarianism''' in Hawk &amp;mdash; but the negation of Wiglesworth's 'dis' coupled with the counter-negation of Hawk's 'anti' does not simply generate a synthetic affirmation of Hatch's 'establishmentarianism'. Instead, Hawk's '''antidisestablishmentarianism''', like a cancerous wart on the end of the nose, is perched at the fuzzy border separating [[ontology]] from [[oncology]], [[malignity]] from [[malignancy]].

====Usage notes====
Known as a superlatively long word, it is, with 28 letters and 12 syllables, probably the longest non-technical and non-contrived word in English. The jocular term {{m|en|floccinaucinihilipilification}} is one letter longer.

==English==

===Etymology===
First used by {{w|Lewis Carroll}} in 1871, based on the concept of two words packed together, like a {{l|en|portmanteau|gloss=a travelling case having two halves joined by a hinge}}.

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{lb|en|linguistics}} A word which combines the meaning of two words (or, rarely, more than two words), formed by combining the words, usually, but not always, by adjoining the first part of one word and the last part of the other, the adjoining parts often having a common vowel; for example, {{m|en|smog}}, formed from {{m|en|smoke}} and {{m|en|fog}}.
#* {{quote-book|en|year=1871|author=Lewis Carroll|authorlink=Lewis Carroll|passage=Well, “{{l|en|slithy}}” means “lithe and slimy”. “Lithe” is the same as “active”. You see it’s like a '''portmanteau''' – there are two meanings packed up into one word.|chapter=[[s:Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There/Chapter VI|VI. Humpty Dumpty]]|title=Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There}}
#* {{quote-journal|1=en|year=2018|author=James Lambert|title=A multitude of ‘lishes’: The nomenclature of hybridity|journal=English World-Wide|page=10|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318367113_A_multitude_of_lishes_The_nomenclature_of_hybridity
|text=One reason for the popularity of '''portmanteau words''' in naming language hybrids may be the fact that the names themselves embody a type of hybridity.}}

===Etymology 7===

====Prefix====

#: '''''a'''new, '''a'''fresh, '''a'''thirst''&lt;ref name=Rand/&gt;

===Usage notes===
Different Germanic senses of ''a-'' became confused – vaguely “intensive” – and are no longer productive. The Greek sense of “not” (e.g., {{m|en|amoral}}, {{m|en|asymmetry}}) remains productive.
: “[I]t naturally happened that all these ''a-'' prefixes were at length confusedly lumped together in idea, and the resultant ''a-'' looked upon as vaguely intensive, rhetorical, [[euphonic]] [nice-sounding], or even archaic, and wholly [[otiose]] [pointless].” OED.

* {{a|Germany}} {{IPA|de|/ap/|/ɑp/}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{der|de|goh|ab}}, from {{der|de|gem-pro|*ab}}.

====Preposition====
{{head|de|preposition}}

# Beginning at that time or location; [[from]].
#: {{ux|de|'''Ab''' heute verfügbar.|Available '''from''' today.}}

=====Derived terms=====
* {{l|de|ab und zu}}

=====Descendants=====
* {{desc|nb|ab}}

===Etymology 2===
From adverbial use of the preposition in verbs such as [[abschlagen]], [[abgehen]] etc.

====Adjective====
{{head|de|adjective}}

# {{lb|de|colloquial|predicative}} [[off]]; not attached to anything anymore
#: {{ux|de|Der Arm ist '''ab'''.|The arm is (hewn) '''off'''.}}
# {{lb|de|nonstandard|attributive}} [[off]]; not attached to anything anymore
#: {{ux|de|Der '''abbe''' Arm ist verschwunden.|The (hewn) '''off''' arm has disappeared.}}

=====Usage notes=====
* The {{l|en|predicative}} use is common in colloquial German throughout the country.
* The {{l|en|attributive}} forms are mostly used in Western and Northern Germany and are considerably less common than the predicative use. They used to be used mostly {{l|en|jocular|jocularly}}, but become gradually more frequent since they are much shorter than the appropriate full verb forms such as {{m|de|abgetrennt||disconnected, severed}}.
* The inflected attributive forms retain the devoiced consonant. Hence, sometimes they are spelled with ''p'', rather than ''b'': ''Appes Bein''.

* {{l|de|abseits}}
